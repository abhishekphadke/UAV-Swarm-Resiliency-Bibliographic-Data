AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be an integral part of the next generation wireless communication networks. Their adoption in various communication-based applications is expected to improve coverage and spectral efficiency, as compared to traditional ground-based solutions. However, this new degree of freedom that will be included in the network will also add new challenges. In this context, the machine-learning (ML) framework is expected to provide solutions for the various problems that have already been identified when UAVs are used for communication purposes. In this article, we provide a detailed survey of all relevant research works, in which ML techniques have been used on UAV-based communications for improving various design and functional aspects such as channel modeling, resource management, positioning, and security.

AB  - Collaboration between multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to establish a Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) is a growing trend since future applications claim for more autonomous and rapidly deployable systems. In this context, Software-Defined Networking FANET (SDN-FANET ) separates the control and data plane and provides network programmability, which considers a centralized controller to perform all FANET control functions based on global UAV context information, such as UAV positions, movement trajectories, residual energy, and others. However, control message dissemination in an SDN-FANET with low overhead and high performance is not a trivial task due to FANET particular characteristics, i.e., high mobility, failures in UAV to UAV communication, and short communication range. With this in mind, it is essential to predict UAV information for control message dissemination as well as consider hierarchical network architecture, reducing bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead. In this article, we present a <b>C</b>luster-b<b>A</b>sed control <b>P</b>lane messages management in s<b>O</b>ftware-defined flying ad-hoc <b>NE</b>twork, called CAPONE. Based on UAV contextual information, the controller can predict UAV information without control message transmission. In addition, CAPONE divides the FANET into groups by computing the number of clusters using the Gap statistics method, which is input for a Fuzzy C-means method to determine the group leader and members. In this way, CAPONE reduces the bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead, while guaranteeing the control message delivering in FANET scenarios. Extensive simulations are used to show the gains of the CAPONE in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio, overhead, and energy compared to existing SDN-FANET architectures.

AB  - This chapter provides a broad introduction to this Handbook on small satellites. It offers information as to why this Handbook was created and its primary uses. It provides guidance as to the structure of the Handbook and its Appendices and a useful information as to how the text of this Handbook and its references can be employed to understand about the history, the technology of small satellites, ground stations and systems for users of these small satellites, the operation of these facilities, launch services, as well as definitions concerning the many different types of these small satellites that exist today. It also provides information, explanations, and definitions about the economic, legal, policy, and regulatory aspects of these systems. It has an entire section devoted to providing information about the many diverse and growing aspects of applications and services that can be used by employing small satellites and how they are uniquely able to provide some of the newer and more entrepreneurial space-based services. There is a chapter that relates the uses of small satellites as a means to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. In short this Handbook seeks to provide a comprehensive set of information about all aspects of smallsats, their uses and applications, the related ground systems, their launch and operation, as well as related economic, legal, policy, business, and financial aspects of these new types of space systems. Finally it seeks to address key issues and challenges for the future that include frequency allocation and management, orbital space debris, space traffic control and management, as well as competitive technological, business, economic, and financial issues. It also notes that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a major impact on the world economy and that this will include a major impact on the small satellite and launch industries. In short there will likely be a number of bankruptcies in this field as a direct or indirect consequence, but these setbacks do not impact the innovative technologies or other information presented in this handbook.

AB  - Typically, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) involve various interconnected systems, which can monitor and manipulate real objects and processes. They are closely related to Internet of Things (IoT) systems, except that CPS focuses on the interaction between physical, networking and computation processes. Their integration with IoT led to a new CPS aspect, the Internet of Cyber-Physical Things (IoCPT). The fast and significant evolution of CPS affects various aspects in people's way of life and enables a wider range of services and applications including e-Health, smart homes, e-Commerce, etc. However, interconnecting the cyber and physical worlds gives rise to new dangerous security challenges. Consequently, CPS security has attracted the attention of both researchers and industries. This paper surveys the main aspects of CPS and the corresponding applications, technologies, and standards. Moreover, CPS security vulnerabilities, threats and attacks are reviewed, while the key issues and challenges are identified. Additionally, the existing security measures are presented and analyzed while identifying their main limitations. Finally, several suggestions and recommendations are proposed benefiting from the lessons learned throughout this comprehensive review.

AB  - The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for collecting data from remotely
located sensor systems is emerging. The data can be time-sensitive and require
to be transmitted to a data processing center. However, planning the trajectory
of a collaborative UAV swarm depends on multi-fold constraints, such as data
collection requirements, UAV maneuvering capacity, and budget limitation. Since
a UAV may fail or be compromised, it is important to provide necessary
resilience to such contingencies, thus ensuring data security. It is important
to provide the UAVs with efficient spatio-temporal trajectories so that they
can efficiently cover necessary data sources. In this work, we present
Synth4UAV, a formal approach for automated synthesis of efficient trajectories
for a UAV swarm by logically modeling the aerial space and data point topology,
UAV moves, and associated constraints in terms of the turning and climbing
angle, fuel usage, data collection point coverage, data freshness, and
resiliency properties. We use efficient, logical formulas to encode and solve
the complex model. The solution to the model provides the routing and
maneuvering plan for each UAV, including the time to visit the points on the
paths and corresponding fuel usage such that the necessary data points are
visited while satisfying the resiliency requirements. We evaluate the proposed
trajectory synthesizer, and the results show that the relationship among
different parameters follow the requirements while the tool scales well with
the problem size.

AB  - A smart grid is a widely distributed engineering system with overhead
transmission lines. Physical damage to these power lines, from natural
calamities or technical failures, will disrupt the functional integrity of the
grid. To ensure the continuation of the grid's operational flow when those
phenomena happen, the grid operator must immediately take steps to nullify the
impacts and repair the problems, even if those occur in hardly-reachable remote
areas. Emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show great potential to replace
traditional human patrols for regularly monitoring critical situations
involving the safety of the grid. The critical lines can be monitored by a
fleet of UAVs to ensure a resilient surveillance system. The proposed approach
considers the \textit{n}-1 contingency analysis to find the criticality of a
transmission line. We propose a formal framework that verifies whether a given
set of UAVs (i.e., a UAV swarm) can perform continuous surveillance of the grid
satisfying various requirements, particularly the monitoring and resiliency
specifications. The verification process ultimately provides a trajectory plan
for the UAVs, including the refueling schedules. The resiliency requirement of
inspecting a point on a line is expressed in terms of a $k-$property specifying
that if $k$ UAVs fail or compromised still there is a UAV to collect the data
at the point within on time. We evaluate the proposed framework on synthetic
data based on various IEEE test bus systems.

AB  - Distributed systems disseminate emergent behaviors across an interconnected group of lightweight agents. The SHARKS protocol (Secure, Heterogeneous, Autonomous, and Rotational Knowledge for Swarms) allows for a robotic swarm to encircle/ensphere a target. Motivated by security and resiliency, the SHARKS protocol addresses traditional vulnerabilities without creating a central point of vulnerability. The SHARKS protocol tolerates the loss of agents and continues to surround a target with as few as three individuals. Utilizing two movement algorithms, agents remain within a specified radial distance of the target while also evenly dispersing from their neighbors. SHARKS was tested in two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D fields. In 2-D fields, the efficiency (how quickly the swarm stabilizes) and the capacity (the number of agents that can stabilize) were tested across different configurations. In 3-D fields, the stability was tested across many additional configurations based on when each swarm reached 68, 95, and 100 stability.

AB  - This paper presents a preliminary work of a simulation study for the evaluation of human-machine team (HMT) performance with assistance of a sentinel system under cyberattacks. Sentinel system is an intelligent agent of cyberattack-detection kit, whose user interface (UI) was designed and implemented as a proof-of-concept in the simulation. The goal for this sentinel system is to improve the pilots’ Situation Awareness (SA) of the system vulnerability and resiliency, such that the HMT performance can be improved against disruptive events. Based on the literature of cyberattacks on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control systems, realistic mission operation and cyberattack scenarios were identified and implemented on a simulated UAV ground control station (GCS). In the follow-up experiment, up to twenty-four Air Force pilots will be instructed to supervise the UAVs under specific mission scenarios, and to respond for system recovery solutions generated on Sentinel UI after detection of cyberattacks. Understanding the interactive behaviors of the pilot and Sentinel under mission contexts and cyberattacks is expected to help improve HMT performance.

Data from UAV sensor systems is communicated between each swarm entity to coordinate a mission without operator or ground control intervention. The use of an autonomous UAV swarm for counter-UAS hosts many benefits over traditional ground-based units such as providing a method for active intervention with a rogue UAS with low regret mitigation methods. This work details preliminary hardware and software testbed development that can be improved upon to create commercial systems.

AB  - The system design of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) poses several challenges for the wireless communication concerning performance, resiliency, and scalability. The UAV system is typically restricted by flying time limitations due to energy constraints and can benefit from coordination of tasks among UAVs. It may further profit from cooperation between UAVs to share information context, maintain flying formation, extend communication range etc. In this paper, we review communication schemes for clusters of autonomous UAVs cooperation. Performance metrics for assessing those schemes are investigated. We provide a survey of candidate wireless communication technologies considering a power line inspection target application. Performance measurements and UAV related channel modeling of those candidate technologies are reviewed. We present how the requirements of the UAVs communication system are identified through the application specification.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is quickly growing with a wide range of current and planned future applications. As the technology grows in usage, the data gathered by UAV systems as well as the UAVs themselves will become bigger targets for cyber-attacks. New cyber security technologies, such as the immutable ledger technology known as blockchain, should therefore be applied to provide a defense against the growing threat of cyber-attacks. This paper explores blockchain technology, first through a general overview of its components and characteristics, and then at what security improvements it can provide to a system. Following this exploration, the application of blockchain to a UAV swarm environment is briefly expanded on. Lastly, one such blockchain framework known as Hyperledger Fabric is explored, that could potentially be applied to a swarm of UAVs to increase its security.

AB  -  Resilience is a system property that enables a system (or system-of-systems) to continue to provide useful service in the face of disruptions. Resilience is especially important for systems that have to operate for extended periods in uncertain, disruptive environments. Resilience approaches today tend to be ad hoc and do not scale. Importantly, it is difficult to assess their long-term impact. This paper presents a flexible contract (FC) approach that employs a combination of formal methods for verification and testing and flexible assertions coupled with probabilistic modeling to handle mission uncertainty. A FC is a hybrid modeling construct that facilitates system verification and testing while offering the requisite flexibility to cope with non-determinism. This paper illustrates the use of FCs for multi-UAV swarm operations in, partially observable, dynamic environments. The approach is sufficiently general for use in other domains such as self-driving vehicles.

AB  - The technology advancement has made Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm a promising method to achieve complicated missions that a single UAV cannot support. Leader-followers formation is a widely used swarm management scenario where a leader drone frequently broadcasts controlling messages to all follower drones to achieve collaboratively a common mission. However, managing such a UAV swarm, especially when the member drones dynamically join and leave the swarm, introduces significant security challenges and performance overhead. In this work, we propose a Swarm Broadcast Protocol (SBP) to facilitate the security protection of leader-followers formation based UAV swarms. SBP contains a security key management scheme that manages a broadcast key among the swarm for leader to broadcast encrypted messages to followers. When swarm membership changes, the broadcast key will be updated and synchronized among the swarm to maintain both backward and forward secrecy. The overhead of SBP is small that only constant computational overhead is needed for both swarm leader and followers to achieve key synchronization when a new drone joins regardless of the current swarm size. This feature would highly reduce the overhead when there are many individual drone joining events. Through experiments on network emulator, we show that SBP achieves lowest bandwidth overhead and CPU utilization to handle multiple swarm membership changing events, comparing with two public-key-based swarm management protocol baselines.

AB  - This chapter presents a model‐based mission assurance (MA) approach that accounts for uncertainties arising from partial observability of the operational environment and employs reinforcement learning based on incoming data (i.e. observations) from the operational environment to progressively determine system states. It presents the closed‐loop, flexible contract‐based, MA concept. Incorporating flexibility in Markovian Decision Process (MDP) consists of: introducing hidden states in MDP representation, thereby making it a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process model; relaxing time‐invariance restriction of the state space and action space; adding an evaluation metric to determine best action; and introducing the concept of time (e.g. temporal constraints/changes in probabilities that impact occurrence of events). The chapter also discusses the different system modeling elements within the context of multi‐unmanned aerial vehicle warm control. These include: traditional contracts; flexible contract, control flow model; swarm control architecture; and iterative Bayesian belief update.

AB  - Modern military warfare is inseparable from the tactics of UAV Ad-hoc network (UANET). Large-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can form an intelligence communication network to monitor, chase and surround targets. However, the network performance of UAVs is highly susceptible to the fast transformation of network topology in the battlefield environment. This paper designs and implements a task-driven OLSR protocol (Td-OLSR) for this problem. It pre-plans the tasks with time and geography, and dynamically adjusts the parameters of the routing protocol according to different tasks. Through the experiment and comparison of the Exata simulation platform, the network performance of Td-OLSR is better and more stable than that of OLSR for UANET.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly popular thanks to the multiplicity of operations in which they can be deployed such as surveillance, search and rescue, mapping, transportation, hobby and recreational activities. Although sensors like LIDARs and cameras are often present on such systems for motion planning to avoid obstacles, collisions can still occur in very dense and unstructured environments, especially if disturbances are present. In this work, we research techniques to recover UAVs after a collision has occurred. We note that the on-board sensors, especially the inertial sensor used to stabilize the UAV, run at a high frequencies obtaining hundreds of data points every second. At run-time, this can be leveraged at the moment of a collision to quickly detect and recover the system. Our approach considers knowledge of UAV system dynamics to predict the expected behavior of the vehicle under safe flight conditions and leverage such expectations together with inertial data to detect collisions rapidly (on the order of milliseconds). We also propose a potential field-based approach to map the collision and create the correct reactive maneuver to avoid the collided object and bring the system back to a stable and safe configuration. Experiments are executed using ROS on two micro-quadrotor UAV platforms having different dynamics and performances, while colliding with poles and walls positioned in different configurations. In our results, we are able to show that the UAVs are successfully able to detect and avoid a collision, while also providing a rigorous analysis of the conditions in which the system can recover from imminent collisions.

AB  - The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in modern military warfare can form an intelligence communication network to monitor, chase and surround targets. However, the network performance of UAVs is highly susceptible to the fast transformation of network topology in the battlefield environment. This paper designs and implements the new OLSR protocol based on dynamic topology (DT-OLSR) for UAV Ad-hoc network (UANET). It dynamically adjusts the broadcast period of Hello messages according to changes in network topology (such as node leaving or joining). Through the experiment and comparison of the Exata and Matlab simulation platform, the network performance of DT-OLSR is better and more stable than the original OLSR. Meanwhile, the routing strategy can truly reflect the improvement effect of network performance when the routing parameters are reasonably set.

AB  - The decreased size and cost of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) has enabled the use of swarms of unmanned autonomous vehicles to accomplish a variety of tasks. By utilizing swarming behaviors, it is possible to efficiently accomplish coordinated tasks while minimizing per-drone computational requirements. Some drones rely on decentralized protocols that exhibit emergent behavior across the swarm. While fully decentralized algorithms remove obvious attack vectors their susceptibility to external influence is less understood. This work investigates the influences that can compromise the functionality of an autonomous swarm leading to hazardous situations and cascading vulnerabilities. When a swarm is tasked with missions involving the safety or health of humans, external influences could have serious consequences. The adversarial swarm in this work utilizes an attack vector embedded within the decentralized movement algorithm of a previously defined autonomous swarm designed to create a perimeter sentry swarm. Various simulations confirm the adversarial swarm’s ability to capture significant portions (6-23%) of the perimeter.

AB  - The advancements of Multiple Robot Systems (MRS) have shown advantages over single robot systems. Generally, the motivations for the development of MRS are task flexibility, time efficiency, and single-point failure resiliency. The challenge in MRS, however, is the control and coordination of all the members in the system when performing tasks. Swarm robotics is a branch of MRS that deals with groups of homogeneous robots. The goal of swarm robotics is to produce systems that are scalable, flexible, and robust. The control of swarm robotic systems, however, looks to be one of the main challenges. These control concepts are inspired by biological swarms and, more recently, physics concepts. The success of the swarm’s control algorithm will also lead to the swarm’s ability to perform cooperative tasks. The use of homogeneous robots in swarm systems makes it advantageous to model the swarm robots as particles in a fluid. The Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) Method, a particle-based method in fluid dynamics, is proposed to be used as a control algorithm for swarm robotics.

AB  - Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) operating as a swarm can be deployed in austere environments, where cyber electromagnetic activities often require speedy and dynamic adjustments to swarm operations. Use of central controllers, uav synchronization mechanisms or pre-planned set of actions to control a swarm in such deployments would hinder its ability to deliver expected services. We introduce artificial intelligence and game theory based flight control algorithms to be run by each autonomous uav to determine its actions in near real-time, while relying only on local spatial, temporal and electromagnetic (em) information. Each uav using our flight control algorithms positions itself such that the swarm maintains mobile ad-hoc network (manet) connectivity and uniform asset distribution over an area of interest. Typical tasks for swarms using our algorithms include detection, localization and tracking of mobile em transmitters. We present a formal analysis showing that our algorithms can guide a swarm to maintain a connected manet, promote a uniform network spreading, while avoiding overcrowding with other swarm members. We also prove that they maintain manet connectivity and, at the same time, they can lead a swarm of autonomous uavs to follow or avoid an em transmitter. Simulation experiments in opnet modeler verify the results of formal analysis that our algorithms are capable of providing an adequate area coverage over a mobile em source and maintain manet connectivity. These algorithms are good candidates for civilian and military applications that require agile responses to the changes in dynamic environments for tasks such as detection, localization and tracking mobile em transmitters.

AB  - The SHARKS protocol enables agents to circle a two-dimensional target or ensphere a three-dimensional target through two simple distributed algorithms that ensure that the drones are equally dispersed from each other and maintain a specified distance from a target. An attack vector was identified in previous work that corrals agents and inhibits the swarms ability to create a perimeter. This research focuses on overcoming this attack without adding extensive overhead to the drones. Three basic techniques are proposed where the legitimate agents eject from their ideal circle around the target. By breaking out of this formation and quickly returning, the agents are able to bypass the adversarial nodes. The results were measured using a security metric based on the total disruption of the adversaries. These experiments showed that the total disruption across the swarm could be less than five percent using ejection strategies that set the ejection distance or the likelihood of ejecting based on the distance between the agents.

To this end, the paper overviews the efforts toward impact analysis and risk evaluation of wildfire and forecasting models to estimate the wildfire damages. Then the solutions to improve different aspects of grid resilience including robustness, resourcefulness, rapid recovery and adaptability are discussed. The mitigation solutions are categorized in four groups including situational awareness, preventive activities, corrective responses, and restorative actions. The state-of-the-art methodologies and algorithms in each category are presented. Challenges and future research opportunities are also discussed in the paper.

AB  - Engineering distributed applications and services in emerging and open computing scenarios like the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems and pervasive computing, calls for identifying proper abstractions to smoothly capture collective behaviour, adaptivity, and dynamic injection and execution of concurrent distributed activities. Accordingly, we introduce a notion of “aggregate process” as a concurrent field computation whose execution and interactions are sustained by a dynamic team of devices, and whose spatial region can opportunistically vary over time. We formalise this notion by extending the Field Calculus with a new primitive construct, spawn, used to instantiate a set of field computations and regulate key aspects of their life-cycle. By virtue of an open-source implementation in the ScaFi framework, we show basic programming examples and benefits via two case studies of mobile ad-hoc networks and drone swarm scenarios, evaluated by simulation.

AB  - Military strategies will shortly make intensive use of autonomous systems while the Internet of Battle Things (IoBT) will grow military systems’ complexity to new heights. The cyber defense of the battlespace will then become arduous for humans, if not impossible, due to disconnections, the difficulty of supervising masses of interconnected devices, and the scarcity of cyber defense competences on the battleground. An autonomous intelligent cyber defense of the battlefield becomes necessary in such a context. In response to such needs, this chapter presents and illustrates the rationale, concept and future research directions of (Multiple) Autonomous Intelligent Cyber defense Agents, (M)AICA, and NATO’s initial AICA Reference Architecture, AICARA.

AB  - In order to enhance the anti-jamming capability of aeronautic swarm tactical network in the complicated electromagnetic environment, we address the problem of bandit-based cognitive anti-jamming strategy for enabling reliable information transmission. We first present an adversarial multiuser multi-armed bandit model for the aeronautic swarm network employing airborne cognitive radios with the same-frequency simultaneous transmit and receive feature. Then, we utilize the improved energy detection method to perform jamming sensing and derive the closed expression of false alarm probability, false detection probability, and the optimal decision threshold in the case of single and multi-jammer. Finally, using the jamming sensing output to calculate reward and with the objective of maximizing the throughput of each airborne radio, a decentralized selfish doubling trick kl-UCB++ anti-jamming strategy is developed to allocate an optimal configuration of transmitting power and spectrum channel to each radio. This anytime bandit strategy is simultaneously minimaxed optimal and asymptotically optimal. The simulation results validate that the aggregate average throughput, cumulative regret obtained with the proposed anti-jamming strategy outperform the well-known UCB, kl-UCB++ bandit algorithm.

AB  - During the last few years, various Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have emerged with numerous network elements interconnected using wired and wireless communication technologies and equipped with strategically placed sensors and actuators. This paper justifies why non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) will bring the IIoT vision closer to reality by providing improved data acquisition and massive connectivity to sensor fields in large and remote areas. NTNs are engineered to utilize satellites, airships, and aircrafts, which can be employed to extend the radio coverage and provide remote monitoring and sensing services. Additionally, this paper describes indicative delay-tolerant massive IIoT and delay-sensitive mission-critical IIoT applications spanning a large number of vertical markets with diverse and stringent requirements. As the heterogeneous nature of NTNs and the complex and dynamic communications scenarios lead to uncertainty and a high degree of variability, conventional wireless communication technologies cannot sufficiently support ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) and offer ubiquitous and uninterrupted interconnectivity. In this regard, this paper sheds light on the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in the provision of challenging NTN-based IIoT services and provides a thorough review of the relevant research works. By adding intelligence and facilitating the decision-making and prediction procedures, the NTNs can effectively adapt to their surrounding environment, thus enhancing the performance of various metrics with significantly lower complexity compared to typical optimization methods.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained popularity for diverse applications and services in both the military and civilian domains. For cooperation and collaboration among UAVs, they can be wirelessly interconnected in an ad hoc manner, resulting in a UAV network. UAV networks have unique features and characteristics that are different from mobile ad hoc networks and vehicular ad hoc networks. The dynamic behavior of rapid mobility and topology changes in UAV networks makes the design of a routing protocol quite challenging. In this paper, we review the routing protocols for UAV networks, in which the topology-based, position-based, hierarchical, deterministic, stochastic, and social-network-based routing protocols are extensively surveyed. The routing protocols are then compared qualitatively in terms of their major features, characteristics, and performance. Open issues and research challenges are also discussed in the perspective of design and implementation.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in assisting 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) mobile networks. Indeed, UAVs have all the potentials to both satisfy the ever-increasing mobile data demands of such mobile networks and provide ubiquitous connectivity to different kinds of wireless devices. However, the UAV assistance paradigm faces a set of crucial issues and challenges. For example, the network management of current UAV-assisted systems is time consuming, complicated, and carried out manually, thus causing a multitude of interoperability issues. To efficiently address all these issues, Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are two promising technologies to efficiently manage and improve the UAV assistance for the next generation of mobile networks. In the literature, no clear guidelines are describing the different use cases of SDN and NFV in the context of UAV assistance to terrestrial networks, including mobile networks. Motivated by this fact, in this survey, we guide the reader through a comprehensive discussion of the main characteristics of SDN and NFV technologies. Moreover, we provide a thorough analysis of the different classifications, use cases, and challenges related to UAV-assisted systems. We then discuss SDN/NFV-enabled UAV-assisted systems, along with several case studies and issues, such as the involvement of UAVs in cellular communications, monitoring, and routing, to name a few. We furthermore present a set of open research challenges, high-level insights, and future research directions related to UAV-assisted systems.

AB  - Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) play a central role in mission critical environments due to the fast deployment, flexible reconfiguration, low cost. In this manner, through the controllable ABSs that are directed to the disaster region, users can continuously remain connected with ABSs. However, ABS deployment and path planning face several key challenges to provide on-demand communication and enable “Quality of Experience (QoE)-guaranteed”service to the users. For example, energy consumption, maximizing the number of covered users and scheduling the ABS’s operations are important issues that need to be considered. Thus, this paper jointly presents a Software Defined Networking (SDN) enabled solution to efficiently deploy ABSs which maximizes the covered users and communication quality, and provides a path planning strategy which decreases the energy consumption. Our simulation is managed with SITL (Software In The Loop) simulator, which allows to create and test drones without a real vehicle using C++ compiler and we confirm the improvement in terms of connectivity and energy consumption when compared to a recent state-of-the-art approach.

AB  - Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica) and the other invasive knotweeds, collectively known as knotweed s.l., are significant invasives worldwide, especially of riparian areas. While R. japonica and other knotweed s.l. can reproduce sexually, their dispersal to and spread within new regions is often accomplished through vegetative reproduction from rhizome and stem fragments. Once established, knotweed s.l. can displace riparian plants, meaning that soil stability once provided by displaced roots is lost, carrying significant knock‐on implications for watershed management. We propose that knotweed s.l. rhizomes both displace roots and the structure they provide to soil, and also amplify bank‐erosion forces, especially during floods. Further, erosive forces create propagules, with larger flow events creating larger numbers of propagules and providing the vector for short‐ and long‐distance downstream spread within the watershed. Induced erosion is therefore the main driver of knotweed s.l. invasions along waterways. As some hydrological regimes shift towards more frequent and severe storm events in response to climate change, positive feedback loops may develop in these regions between existing knotweed s.l. populations, sudden riverbank failure, and increased flood‐related damage, with presumably significant impacts on riparian infrastructure. While the continued spread of this invasive could have significant riparian flood resiliency consequences if left unchecked, mindful action to control these plants is likely to be beneficial financially, socially, and ecologically within any invaded watershed.

AB  - This article presents a knowledge mining model, where a city can plan its development based on existing knowledge during city expansion, for example, telecommunication resource allocation and crowd forecasts in a new region. Unlike most works that focused on Internet-of-Things (loT) sensing, this study is aimed at urban planning by using harvested data, from the perspective of city architects. For large-scale metropolitan areas, a massive amount of data is generated every day, either from static surveys or dynamic loT sensing. For urban planners, data collection is not their primary concern. How to transfer harvested knowledge from exiting parts of the city to suburban/rural/untapped areas is a new challenge. This is because those areas still lack sufficient statistics, and the density of IoT deployment is low. Therefore, development is risky and uncertain. To exploit new regions requires knowledge inference. Such a transition needs data interpretation from historical city dynamics, involving sensor deployment, human activities, and resource allocation in the vicinity. With the proposed model, a city can estimate the requirement for resources when the peripheral areas on the outskirts of a city develop. The same model can be applied to enterprises for resource deployment, and applications are not merely limited to governments.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles that abbreviates (UAVs) are flying platforms, known as drones, which have features such as mobility, adaptive altitude and flexibility. UAVs admit numerous applications that can be used as aerial base stations to enhance coverage, capacity, and energy efficiency of wireless networks. On the other hand, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals within a cellular network. Such cellular-connected UAVs can enable several applications ranging from real-time video streaming to item delivery. A Software Defined Network (SDN) Controller is the application that acts as a strategic control point in a software-defined network. It is the ’brain’ of the network. Controller manages flow control to the routers/switches ‘under’ (via southbound APIs), the business logic and applications ’above’ (via northbound APIs) to deploy intelligent networks. Wireless networking with software defined (SDWN) is the use of SDN conceptions in wireless networks by using a controller in the control plane. SDWN facilitates the creation of new adaptive mechanisms according to various applications and user requirements, such as mobility, handover, security and quality of service (QoS). In this paper, simulation work has been conducted to compare and investigate four SDN controllers (Pox, Ryu, Floodlight and OpenDaylight) in order to see which one is suitable to be used. Mininet-Wifi has been selected as the simulation tool to do the experiments and Python script for programming. The results obtained reveals that Ryu controller is the best selection in terms of latency and packet loss.

AB  - We are developing an agent-based model that allows us to explore control and distributed machine learning concepts in a systems-of-systems framework. The model captures the complex interactions between vehicles with very different operational tempos (such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) and a variety of environmental elements (communication towers, objects of interest, etc.). Treating the model as a complex adaptive system, we can explore issues of controllability and observability, such as the constraints needed to maintain multi-vehicle formations under diverse conditions, and scaling questions, such as the data rates among vehicles and control centers under diverse system parameters.

AB  - The recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) upsurges its usages in commercial and civilian applications such as surveillance, rescue, and crowdsensing. UAVs are vulnerable to being destroyed, lost, or stolen in case of security breaches of its network. The network management of UAVs is a crucial task due to its high mobility, which necessitates UAV network softwarization. Then, it becomes indispensable that allows the separation of control functions (i.e., control plane data) from hardware for smooth execution of complex operations. Further, UAV uses the Internet (an open channel) for communication in its complex system that raises a network security concern. The well-known softwarization techniques, i.e., software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) can be used to accomplish the secure network services on less expense. Conversely, these softwarization techniques may suffer from various threats like access control, user authentication, controller hijacking, and many more attack. The existing solutions are using a centralized system, which is having a single point of failure issue and vulnerable to security threats. Motivated from these facts, we present a comprehensive and systematic survey on the blockchain-based softwarization for a secure UAV network. Then, we propose a blockchain-enabled UAV softwarization architecture for secure communication and network management. It provides dynamic, flexible, and on-the-fly decision capabilities for communication services over the UAV network. Eventually, we analyzed the open research issues and challenges for future research directions in this emerging area.

AB  -  The technological advancements in the ubiquitous IoT era and the ever-growing desire of communities to enforce smart cities with security and safety of user data as their priority, mini Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are perceived as a tool for raising living standards by meeting the requirements of societies. Traditionally in UAV communication links, meshed ad hoc networks were among the first options of connectivity. However, the increased demand for deploying multi-UAV networks necessitates the development of a more robust and more secure networking infrastructure. In this regard, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has proved to be the better alternative for multi-UAV communication since it can offer flexible services for management and control owing to its unique features such as decoupling control from UAVs and network programmability. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an overview of drone applications in SDN-enabled Drone Base Stations (DBS), surveillance monitoring and emergency networks, and review the performance assessment techniques and the associated cybersecurity aspects in these applications. Moreover, future research directions, after a thorough analysis of the literature, is presented in this paper. Through the development of an innovative and multifaceted drone performance-assessment framework with the primal concerns, that are meeting user-defined requirements and the provision of secure and reliable services, it is, therefore, necessary to advance in IoT-enabled spaces. We believe the present work is a step in the right direction, and it is essential for fastening the movement towards UAV-enabled smart cities.

We provide a brief survey of current deployed mobile autonomous systems and their capabilities (with a primary focus on the air domain but including other domains—underwater, ground, space, and surface—as well). We discuss techniques that are currently used for achieving resiliency and assurance in autonomous navigation, pointing out some of the shortcomings of these techniques. We describe techniques under development in the industry that aims to overcome these shortcomings by combining emerging approaches to resilient behavior with assured autonomous behavior constructs to yield reliable and mission-effective systems necessary to operate successfully in dynamic and adversarial environments. We briefly discuss ongoing efforts to develop multidomain standards that are designed to be applicable across these disparate vehicle domains.

AB  - Intercepting and impeding an opponent is a fairly common behavior in contact and collision sports such as soccer, football, lacrosse or basketball. In soccer, for example, the main objective of a defender is to intercept and impede an attacking opponent as he or she navigates toward the goal. These athlete vs. athlete interactions often lead to collisions, and the uncertainty surrounding them frequently leads to injury. A virtual reality (VR) training platform with non-player characters (NPC) that can anticipate an athletes decisions would, therefore, be a desirable tool to be used by sports trainers to safely and effectively promote the resiliency of athletes to these types of situations. Here we applied this platform to a VR task that required the athletes to run past a series of NPCs to reach a stationary virtual waypoint, or goal. Each NPC is modeled as a Genetic Fuzzy System (GFS) that is trained using a new methodology, called FuzzyBolt, that is capable of training large fuzzy logic systems efficiently to provide better predictive quality. The end result is that such an intelligent NPC is able to more accurately predict athlete movements such that it becomes more difficult for the athlete to successfully navigate around the NPC and to the virtual goal. This, in turn, forces the athlete to develop new movement and decision making strategies in order to evade the NPC, thus enhancing their resiliency and ultimately reducing the risk of collision-based injury on the field of play.

AB  - Many Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) utilize power analysis to obtain sensitive material such as encryption keys and is one of the demonstrated threats to embedded systems. Masking is an effective Counter-measure against SCA; however, its implementation correctness is difficult to evaluate. Currently, most verification work is based on hardware electronics design and analysis tools. However, control and diagnostic applications typically are implemented using Simulink or similar tools. This paper explores the analysis of masking effectiveness using Simulink. Our method focuses on exploring the feasibility of random simulation and statistical analysis to achieve an approximate evaluation, to rule out the obvious unqualified designs. The paper also develops a solution for rigorous formal verification when the system is too complex to be handled by the verification tool, which addresses the state space explosion issue, one of the major obstacles for applying formal verification.

AB  - Recently, the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices combined with edge computing opened many opportunities for several novel applications. Typical examples are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) that are deployed for photogrammetry, surveillance, disaster rapid response and environmental monitoring. A common challenge across all these networked applications is the ability to provide a persistent service - a service able to continuously maintain a high level of performance - responding to events that may change the state of the network, e.g., nodes or link failures. To cope with this challenge, in this paper we propose APRON, an edge cloud-assisted architecture for distributed and adaptive task planning management in a network of IoT devices, e.g., drones. APRON uses a novel planning strategy that, leveraging a Jackson's network model, supports monitoring and control operations while the states of the (edge or cloud) network evolve. By using APRON, edge computing application programmers can design and implement a wide range of IoT task management policies leveraging different protection methodologies across several failure models.

AB  - Two main factors, including regression accuracy and adversarial attack robustness, of six trajectory prediction models are measured in this paper using the traffic flow management system (TFMS) public dataset of fixed-wing aircraft trajectories in a specific route provided by the Federal Aviation Administration. Six data-driven regressors with their desired architectures, from basic conventional to advanced deep learning, are explored in terms of the accuracy and reliability of their predicted trajectories. The main contribution of the paper is that the existence of adversarial samples was characterized for an aircraft trajectory problem, which is recast as a regression task in this paper. In other words, although data-driven algorithms are currently the best regressors, it is shown that they can be attacked by adversarial samples. Adversarial samples are similar to training samples; however, they can cause finely trained regressors to make incorrect predictions, which poses a security concern for learning-based trajectory prediction algorithms. It is shown that although deep-learning-based algorithms (e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM)) have higher regression accuracy with respect to conventional classifiers (e.g., support vector regression (SVR)), they are more sensitive to crafted states, which can be carefully manipulated even to redirect their predicted states towards incorrect states. This fact poses a real security issue for aircraft as adversarial attacks can result in intentional and purposely designed collisions of built-in systems that can include any type of learning-based trajectory predictor.

AB  - Collaborative heterogeneous robotic systems are distributed and interconnected multi-robot systems whose members can have different capabilities and can perform specialised tasks. Existing engineering processes and tools facilitate the development of various robotic aspects including kinematics, sensing and, architecture, through high-level design and low-level code generation. Although there are several frameworks and middleware, providing infrastructure for the development of single-robot and homogeneous multi-robot applications, there is lack of systematic methods and tools supporting the engineering of heterogeneous multi-robot systems and the analysis of collaborative intelligence. In this paper, we present our vision for a framework that supports the specification of collaborative heterogeneous robotic systems, generation of platform-specific code, and efficient exploration and exercise of collective intelligence algorithms.

AB  - Recently, aerial networks have been offered as assistant communication infrastructures against some temporary operations especially in mission critical events. However, the lifetime of an aerial component is much less than the estimated operational time because of power supply capacity restrictions. Thus, there should be some replenishment processes between Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) to maintain the physical presence of the topology, i.e. the endurance. During a replenishment process, the relation between energy consumption and flight characteristic of a drone should be carefully taken in to account, because motional energy consumption is much more than the communicational and computational ones. For this purpose, we provide an energy aware endurance framework by modeling an energy consumption digraph model, representing an Aerial Pickup and Delivery Problem (APDP) for flight planning and implementing a novel algorithmic solution. Moreover, replenishment factor (γ) and flight planning cost (δ) parameters are presented to compare the evaluation of the proposed method with a simple replenishment approach. A social event in a stadium is selected as the evaluation environment, and is simulated for three scenarios using Software in the Loop (SITL) simulator with MAVLink Proxy drone controller. According to the evaluation results obtained from simulation logs, our design provides 13% more endurance per ABS (η), an average of 15% less energy consumption w.r.t. δ parameter and 11% less γ value compared to the simple replenishment strategy.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewMulti-robot exploration—i.e., the problem of mapping unknown features of an environment—is fundamental in many tasks, including search and rescue, planetary exploration, and environmental monitoring. This article surveys recent literature with the aim at identifying current research trends, open challenges, and future directions.Recent FindingsSince the first formalization of the exploration problem, current research has extended systems and algorithms to map 3D environments and more complex phenomena and considered real-world constraints. Deep learning-based approaches have seen some preliminary applications in decision-making.SummaryWhile current research has been progressing towards systems that can work in the real world, long-term exploration in large unstructured environments with complex phenomena to map is still an open problem. This introduces opportunities for exciting research, including but not limited to generalized frameworks that bridge the gap between theory and practice, learning-based approaches, and robustness to failure and attacks, so that robots can be deployed safely in real-world environments.

AB  - This paper investigates microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology sensors. The device- and system-level analyses are performed. An investigation is focused on multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) microsystem-technology inertial sensors which are widely used in mobile devices, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms, wearable electronics, guidance and navigation systems, etc. Open problems of data quality (DQ) in sensor networks, evaluation of sensor data, data fusion, DQ improvement, and data homogeneity in MDOF sensors are addressed. The DQ metrics design and their use are reported. Our research and algorithmic developments are focused on data assertion, adaptive signal processing, asynchronous data fusion and data management from heterogeneous multiple sensors and sensor networks. Using a serial protocol I2C interface, considered MDOF sensors can fuse the directly measured data, as well as output the post-processed data. The integrated sensors (triaxial accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers) ensure physics-consistent data-intensive processing, advance modalities, interoperability, integration, compliance and redundancy. Alternative solutions in adaptive filtering and near-real-time reconfigurable signal processing are considered to enable dynamic range, improve precision and accuracy, ensure robustness, minimize uncertainties, etc. The experimental results are reported.

AB  - Consider a user who needs to perform computation over an initially unbounded stream of input. The user would like to compute functions of the input that change dynamically due to external events. The focus of this work is outsourcing such computation to a set of agents. The outsourcing must meet several constraints. Any large enough subset of agents must correctly emulate the user's computation on the unbounded stream of input. Any small subset of agents must obtain as little information as possible on the user's data, including the computed functions and any initial input. This privacy assurance must be maintained in an information-theoretic sense. Finally, the set of agents is dynamic with agents joining and leaving the set and different sets of agents being merged, cloned or split. In this work, we show how to securely outsource such perennial computation. The user's required computation is modeled as programs for a universal Turing machine. The only information that the agents obtain on the user's secrets is an upper bound on the space complexity required to perform the computation. Each state transition of the user's Turing machine requires computation and communication that are linear in the Turing machine's space complexity and polynomial in the number of agents performing the computation for every round of computation. The communication and computational complexity for an agent joining or leaving the set of computing agents in a transition round are linear in the space complexity of the Turing machine and polynomial in the number of agents. Some of the tools we develop may be of independent interest. We construct a strongly oblivious Turing machine, in which the tape head moves only as a function of its current location. We also show how to securely share the description of a Turing machine among several agents and how to securely compute each Turing machine's transition in a constant number of communication rounds.

AB  - Smart power grids are being enhanced by adding a communication infrastructure to improve their reliability, sustainability, and efficiency. Despite all of these significant advantages, their open communication architecture and connectivity renders the power systems vulnerability to a range of cyberattacks. This article proposes a novel resilient control system for load frequency control (LFC) system under false data injection (FDI) attacks. It is common to use encryption in data transfer links as the first layer of defending mechanism; here, we propose a second defense layer that can jointly detect and mitigate FDI attacks on power systems. In this article, we propose a new anomaly detection technique that consists of a Luenberger observer and an artificial neural network (ANN). Since FDI attacks can happen rapidly, the observer structure is enhanced by the extended Kalman filter to improve the ANN ability for online detection and estimation. The resilient controller is designed based on the attack estimation, which can eliminate the need for control reconfiguration. The resiliency of the proposed design against FDI attacks is tested on the LFC system. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed control system can successfully detect anomalies and compensate for their adverse effects.

AB  - Increasingly, safety and liability critical applications require GNSS-like positioning metrics in environments where GNSS cannot work. Indoor navigation for the vision impaired and other mobility restricted individuals, emergency responders and asset tracking in buildings demand levels of positioning accuracy and integrity that cannot be satisfied by current indoor positioning technologies and techniques. This paper presents the challenges facing positioning technologies for indoor positioning and presents innovative algorithms and approaches that aim to enhance performance in these difficult environments. The overall aim is to achieve GNSS-like performance in terms of autonomous, global, infrastructure free, portable and cost efficient. Preliminary results from a real-world experimental campaign conducted as part of the joint FIG Working Group 5.5 and IAG Sub-commission 4.1 on multi-sensor systems, demonstrate performance improvements based on differential Wi-Fi (DWi-Fi) and cooperative positioning techniques. The techniques, experimental schema and initial results will be fully documented in this paper.

AB  - We present a novel scheme called Decentralized Attestation for Device Swarms (DADS), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to accomplish decentralized attestation in device swarms. Device swarms are smart, mobile, and interconnected devices that operate in large numbers and are likely to be part of emerging applications in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). Swarm devices process and exchange safety, privacy, and mission-critical information. Thus, it is important to have a good code verification technique that scales to device swarms and establishes trust among collaborating devices. DADS has several advantages over current state-of-the-art swarm attestation techniques: It is decentralized, has no single point of failure, and can handle changing topologies after nodes are compromised. DADS assures system resilience to node compromise/failure while guaranteeing only devices that execute genuine code remain part of the group. We conduct performance measurements of communication, computation, memory, and energy using the TrustLite embedded systems architecture in OMNeT++ simulation environment. We show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce communication cost and is very efficient in terms of computation, memory, and energy requirements. We also analyze security and show that DADS is very effective and robust against various attacks.

AB  - The concept of the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is being widely applied to service provisioning in many domains, including smart healthcare, intelligent transportation, autopilot, and the smart grid. However, because of the IIoT devices’ limited onboard resources, supporting resource-intensive applications, such as 3D sensing, navigation, AI processing, and big-data analytics, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we study the multi-hop computation-offloading problem for the IIoT–edge–cloud computing model and adopt a game-theoretic approach to achieving Quality of service (QoS)-aware computation offloading in a distributed manner. First, we study the computation-offloading and communication-routing problems with the goal of minimizing each task's computation time and energy consumption, formulating the joint problem as a potential game in which the IIoT devices determine their computation-offloading strategies. Second, we apply a free–bound mechanism that can ensure a finite improvement path to a Nash equilibrium. Third, we propose a multi-hop cooperative-messaging mechanism and develop two QoS-aware distributed algorithms that can achieve the Nash equilibrium. Our simulation results show that our algorithms offer a stable performance gain for IIoT in various scenarios and scale well as the device size increases.

I am delighted to present a terrific technical conference that is focused on a theme, “UTM to ATM Airspace Integration – role of spectrum, AI, machine learning and automation”, that will shape the future of aviation for generations to come. We can envision avionics systems that learn from its environment, then extrapolate that knowledge to future scenarios using AI-based decision support systems (DSS) mimicking human learning. The DSS could be selfcontained within the autonomous platform or shared and distributed through the cloud. Knowledge sharing among autonomous systems will require very high throughpu, secure and resilint communication networks.

AB  - Future satellite networks could benefit from new paradigms that are currently applied to terrestrial networks, as Software Defined Networking (SDN)and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV); these can improve key system characteristics as flexibility, customization, scalability, etc. This paper presents an analysis on the use of SDN for the optimization of High throughput Satellite (HTS)systems. The latter will use EHF (in particular beyond Ka-band frequencies, such as Q/V and W bands)in the feeder link and in this framework it is mandatory to use spatial diversity to counteract tropospheric fading. One of the most interesting diversity scheme is “smart gateway”; this technique has to be carefully optimized to achieve high system performance. This paper shows that SDN is a good candidate for the intelligent management of this system. In particular, the paper shows an analysis of the use of the SDN paradigm for smart gateway socalled “N+0” and “N+P” diversity schemes. The two schemes allow, in case of heavy fading conditions on one gateway, the redirection of the user traffic towards a redundant gateway (N + P), or the partition of the lost capacity over different active gateways (N + 0), ensuring service continuity.

AB  - Nowadays, network technologies are essential for transferring and storing various information of users, companies, and industries. However, the growth of the information transfer rate expands the attack surface, offering a rich environment to intruders. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widespread systems able to passively or actively control intrusive activities in a defined host and network perimeter. Recently, different IDSs have been proposed by integrating various detection techniques, generic or adapted to a specific domain and to the nature of attacks operating on. The cybersecurity landscape deals with tremendous diverse event streams that exponentially increase the attack vectors. Event stream processing (ESP) methods appear to be solutions that leverage event streams to provide actionable insights and faster detection. In this paper, we briefly describe domains (as well as their vulnerabilities) on which recent papers were-based. We also survey standards for vulnerability assessment and attack classification. Afterwards, we carry out a classification of IDSs, evaluation metrics, and datasets. Next, we provide the technical details and an evaluation of the most recent work on IDS techniques and ESP approaches covering different dimensions (axes): domains, architectures, and local communication technologies. Finally, we discuss challenges and strategies to improve IDS in terms of accuracy, performance, and robustness.

AB  - Today, blockchain uses a list of various blocks for storing a distributed flat of invariable information that informs of a set of replicated logical things in the Internet of Things (IoT). In the blockchain, a set of blocks includes various transactions containing a cryptographic hash value and a timestamp. Blockchain‐as‐a‐service (BaaS) as a new service in cloud providers presents an infrastructure for accessing users to execute, manage, and monitor blockchain applications without high secured infrastructure requirements. Recently, BaaS concepts widely have used the management of IoT applications in different layers such as network, data, control, and resource. This paper provides a systematic review of recent research studies in BaaS models. The main goal behind this review is to categorize the applied scenarios, trends, evaluated Quality of Service (QoS) factors, new challenges, and open directions on BaaS models in IoT management. To evaluate the existing research studies in this field, five analytical research questions are proposed to analyze the technical aspects of each study. The analytical results based on existing research questions specify that the BaaS models are applied to network layer to manage IoT environment more than other layers. Also, security and privacy are two important factors to evaluate the existing BaaS models in cloud‐edge IoT environments. Finally, the integration of BaaS models on IoT environments with interconnections of cloud‐edge computing and software defined networks creates great secure opportunities for smart environment applications to monitor, manage, and improve all the atomic services and resources.

AB  - Autonomous unmanned vehicles can support a wide range of missions, which are typically coordinated by a human operator. Automating these missions through a computer program can offer great advantages, but at the same time introduces several challenges. In particular, it becomes important to tolerate failures of the mission controller, including the most general type, namely Byzantine failures. To address this challenge, we propose an active replication approach adapted to the characteristics of this particular type of system. Our solution relies on signed messages and requires N = 2 f + 1 mission controller replicas to tolerate f Byzantine failures. We describe the system model and the mechanisms that need to be in place to achieve the desired functionality, and argue about the correctness of the proposed approach in an informal way. Also, we evaluate the overheads of a prototype implementation through indicative simulation experiments.

AB  - The behavioral analysis of cyber-physical systems in safety-critical scenarios is a challenging task. In this paper, the endogenous and exogenous aspects of resilience are of cornerstone importance in system design and verification. Endogenous resilience is the inherent ability of the system to detect and process internal faults and malicious attacks. Exogenous resilience is the permanent capability of the system to maintain a safe operation within its ambient environment. In this paper, we present a predictive dual-sided contract-based formal methodology to address both aspects of resilience on top of a distributed object-oriented component-based software model. It is illustrated by a case study of urban drone rescue systems. We exploit the formalism of timed automat a and the toolbox UPPAAL to predict by abstraction and analyze (simulate and verify) endogenous resilience. Instead of presenting the final models of the case study, we reflect our experience with UPPAAL in generic patterns of system design and contract specification, reusable in other contexts with adaptations. The analysis of exogenous resilience is specific to the considered drone rescue system. It consists of synthesizing by iterative model-checking safe flight paths for the drones within a 3D virtual model of urban surroundings true to modern cities.

AB  - The paper describes a vision for dependable application of machine learning-based inferencing on resource-constrained edge devices. The high computational overhead of sophisticated deep learning learning techniques imposes a prohibitive overhead, both in terms of energy consumption and sustainable processing throughput, on such resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., audio or video sensors). To overcome these limitations, we propose a “cognitive edge” paradigm, whereby (a) an edge device first autonomously uses statistical analysis to identify potential collaborative IoT nodes, and (b) the IoT nodes then perform real-time sharing of various intermediate state to improve their individual execution of machine intelligence tasks. We provide an example of such collaborative inferencing for an exemplar network of video sensors, showing how such collaboration can significantly improve accuracy, reduce latency and decrease communication bandwidth compared to non-collaborative baselines. We also identify various challenges in realizing such a cognitive edge, including the need to ensure that the inferencing tasks do not suffer catastrophically in the presence of malfunctioning peer devices. We then introduce the soon-to-be deployed Cognitive IoT testbed at SMU, explaining the various features that enable empirical testing of various novel edge-based ML algorithms.

AB  - This paper considers the cooperative synchronization problem for multi-agent systems with a directed communication graph under potential DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks, which destruct communications and measurement channels of the agents. The resilient control method consisting of a virtual system with hidden network is proposed to maintain the stability and convergence of the cooperative systems in the presence of the attacks. In contrast to previous related works against the DoS attack, the proposed approach can ensure the synchronization of multi-agent systems with unknown attack frequency and duration.

AB  - This paper proposes an efficient converter for the usage of hybrid renewable energy sources and reduced switching loss in the Micro Grid associated frameworks. The work resulted in a DC–DC converter for module integration and maximum power point tracking with an efficient adaptive control scheme. The proposed control scheme is a combined execution of both the adaptive grasshopper optimization algorithm (AGOA) and artificial neural network (ANN) named as AGONN strategy. In the proposed strategy, the AGOA plays out the evaluation technique to set up the correct control signals for the system and develops the control signals database for the offline way subject to the power exchange between source side and the load side. Moreover, to train the ANN system for the online way, the achieved dataset is utilized and it drives the control method in less execution time. Also, the objective function is characterized by the system data subject to equality and inequality constraints. The constraints are the accessibility of the renewable energy sources, power demand and the state of charge of storage elements. Batteries are used as an energy source, to balance out and allow the renewable power system units to continue running at a steady and stable output power. By then, the proposed show is executed in MATLAB/Simulink working platform and the execution is surveyed with the current methods.

AB  - Existing public safety networks (PSNs) are not designed to cope with disasters such as terrorist attacks, consequently leading to long delays and intolerable response times. First responders’ life threats when accessing the attacked zone are more severe in comparison to other disasters and the accuracy of basic information such as the number of terrorists, the number of trapped people, their locations and identity, etc., is vital to the reduction of the response time. Recent technologies for PSNs are designed to manage natural disaster scenarios; these are not best suited for situations like terrorist attacks because a proper communication infrastructure is required for operating most of the classical PSNs. This serious concern makes it highly desirable to develop reliable and adaptive pervasive public safety communication technologies to counter such a kind of emergency situation. Device-to-device (D2D) communication can be a vital paradigm to design PSNs that are fit for dealing with terrorist attacks thanks to long-term evolution (LTE)-sidelink, which could allow the devices that people carry with themselves in the attacked zone to communicate directly. To our best knowledge, this is the first survey paper on public safety communication in the context of terrorist attacks. We discuss PSN scenarios, architectures, 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards, and recent or ongoing related projects. We briefly describe a system architecture for disseminating the critical information, and we provide an extensive literature review of the technologies that could have a significant impact in public safety scenarios especially in terrorist attacks, such as beamforming and localization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), LTE sidelink for both centralized (base-station assisted) and decentralized (without base-station) architectures, multi-hop D2D routing for PSN, and jamming and anti-jamming in mobile networks. Furthermore, we also cover the channel models available in the literature to evaluate the performance of D2D communication in different contexts. Finally, we discuss the open challenges when applying these technologies for PSN.

AB  - This chapter builds on the Revolution in Military Logistics (RML) concept, as defined by the U.S. Army in 1999, by conceiving of logistics transformation as a prerequisite for any Revolution in Military Affairs or broader force transformation at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Looking past the tip of the spear, this chapter analyses how emerging critical technologies may facilitate a paradigmatic shift in land-based combat service support emphasizing greater agility, modularity, seamlessness, control, and sustainability. The chapter considers technological enablers—including artificial intelligence, alternative energy technologies, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, robotics, blockchain and the Internet of Things—which may make logistics more efficient and effective, yet which have only been developed or fielded in an ad hoc way. With a view toward integrating the technologies into operational concepts and organisational constructs, the chapter assesses the merits, as well as vulnerabilities and cultural difficulties, of transforming future military logistics.

AB  - Autonomous multi-robot systems, where a team of robots shares information to perform tasks that are beyond an individual robot’s abilities, hold great promise for a number of applications, such as planetary exploration missions. Each robot in a multi-robot system that uses the shared-world coordination paradigm autonomously schedules which robot should perform a given task, and when, using its worldview–the robot’s internal representation of its belief about both its own state, and other robots’ states. A key problem for operators is that robots’ worldviews can fall out of sync (often due to weak communication links), leading to desynchronization of the robots’ scheduling decisions and inconsistent emergent behavior (e.g., tasks not performed, or performed by multiple robots). Operators face the time-consuming and difficult task of making sense of the robots’ scheduling decisions, detecting de-synchronizations, and pinpointing the cause by comparing every robot’s worldview. To address these challenges, we introduce MOSAIC Viewer, a visual analytics system that helps operators (i) make sense of the robots’ schedules and (ii) detect and conduct a root cause analysis of the robots’ desynchronized worldviews. Over a year-long partnership with roboticists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we conduct a formative study to identify the necessary system design requirements and a qualitative evaluation with 12 roboticists. We find that MOSAIC Viewer is faster- and easier-to-use than the users’ current approaches, and it allows them to stitch low-level details to formulate a high-level understanding of the robots’ schedules and detect and pinpoint the cause of the desynchronized worldviews.

AB  - The fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are on the way to be deployed around the world. The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.

AB  -  The resilience of multi-agent systems (MAS) measures the capability of recovering the cooperative performance after experiencing faults or uncertainties. In this paper, we seek the improvement of the synchronization resilience for MAS by means of addressing unknown faults on communication links. To this end, we first transform the resilient control problem into designing distributed state observers. In addition, we show that the proposed state observers are resilient to communication link faults. Finally, we provide the main result of this paper as a synchronization protocol for MAS even in the presence of communication link faults.

AB  - Several heterogeneous, intelligent, and distributed devices can be connected to interact with one another over the Internet in what is termed internet of things (IoT). Also, the concept of IoT can be exploited in the industrial environment for enhancing the production of goods and services and for mitigating the risk of disaster occurrences. This application of IoT for enhancing industrial production is known as industrial IoT (IIoT). Emergent configuration (EC) is a technology that can be adopted to enhance the operation and collaboration of IoT connected devices in order to improve the efficiency of the connected IoT systems for maximum user satisfaction. To meet user goals, the connected devices are required to cooperate with one another in an adaptive, interoperable, and homogeneous manner. In this paper, a survey of the concept of IoT is presented in addition to a review of IIoT systems. The application of ubiquitous computing-aided software define networking (SDN)-based EC architecture is propounded for enhancing the throughput of oil and gas production in the maritime ecosystems by managing the exploration process especially in emergency situations that involve anthropogenic oil and gas spillages.

AB  - Faults and failures in the system components are two main reasons for the instability and the degradation in control performance. In recent decades, fault-tolerant control (FTC) approaches have been introduced to improve the resiliency of control systems against faults and failures. In general, FTC techniques are classified into active and passive approaches. This paper reviews fault and failure causes in control systems and discusses the latest solutions that are introduced to make the control system resilient.The recent achievements in fault detection and isolation (FDI) approaches and active FTC designs are investigated. Furthermore, a thorough comparison of several different aspects is conducted to understand the advantage and disadvantages of various FTC techniques to motivate researchers to further developing FTC and FDI approaches.

AB  - A crucial problem in post-flood recovery actions is the ability to rapidly establish communication and collaboration among rescuers to conduct timely and effective search and rescue (SAR) mission given disrupted telecommunication infrastructure to support the service. Aimed at providing such proximity service (ProSe) for mission-critical data exchange in the post-flood environment, the majority of existing solutions rely heavily upon ad-hoc networking approaches, which suffer from restricted communication range and the limited scope of interaction. As an effort to broaden the ProSe coverage and expand integrated global-local information exchange in the post-flood SAR activities, this paper proposes a novel network architecture in the form of a cyber-enabled mission-critical system (CEMCS) for acquiring and communicating post-flood emergency data by exploiting TV white space spectrum as network backhaul links. The primary method of developing the proposed system builds upon a layered architecture of wireless local, regional and wide-area communications, and incorporates collaborative network components among these layers. The desirable functionalities of CEMCS are showcased through formulation and the development of an efficient global search strategy exploiting a wide range of collaboration among network agents. The simulation results demonstrate the capability of CEMCS to provide ProSe in the post-flood scenarios as reflected by reliable network performance (e.g., packet delivery ratio nearing 80%–90%) and the optimality of efficient search algorithm.

AB  - Blockchain technologies have recently come to the forefront of the research and industrial communities as they bring potential benefits for many industries. This is due to their practical capabilities in solving many issues currently inhibiting further advances in various industrial domains. Securely recording and sharing transactional data, establishing automated and efficient supply chain processes, and enhancing transparency across the whole value chain are some examples of these issues. Blockchain offers an effective way to tackle these issues using distributed, shared, secure, and permissioned transactional ledgers. The employment of blockchain technologies and the possibility of applying them in different situations enables many industrial applications through increased efficiency and security; enhanced traceability and transparency; and reduced costs. In this paper, different industrial application domains where the use of blockchain technologies has been proposed are reviewed. This paper explores the opportunities, benefits, and challenges of incorporating blockchain in different industrial applications. Furthermore, the paper attempts to identify the requirements that support the implementation of blockchain for different industrial applications. The review reveals that several opportunities are available for utilizing blockchain in various industrial sectors; however, there are still some challenges to be addressed to achieve better utilization of this technology.

AB  - This paper explores a formation control design which is resilient against malfunctioning communications. The goal is to have each agent, modeled in the relative motion Hill frame, to orbit around a target point using only neighboring information. The proposed approach leverages our previous work in satellite formation control which uses a Lyapunov-based formation control solution. To mitigate the effect of malfunctioning agents communicating miss-information on the network which would cause errors in the control algorithm, each agent applies a modified weighted mean-subsequence reduced consensus algorithm to the formation control problem. This algorithm compares the communicated information on the location of the malfunctioning agents to the predefined formation cooperating agents can identify and isolate such defunct agents. Results are illustrated in a ten spacecraft simulation orbiting around a single satellite at the origin and compares the case between malfunctioning satellites and non-malfunctioning satellites.

AB  - The evolution of 5G into beyond 5G and 6G networks aims at responding to the increasing need of our society of ubiquitous and continuous connectivity services in all areas of our life: from education to finance, from politics to health, from entertainment to environment protection. The next generation network communication infrastructure is called to support this increasing demand of connectivity by enforcing: energy- and costefficiency to guarantee environmental and economical sustainability; scalability, flexibility, and adaptability to ensure support to the heterogeneity of the service characteristics and constraints, as well as the variety of equipment; reliability and dependability to fulfil its role of critical infrastructure able to provide global connectivity no matter the social, political, or environmental situation. In this framework, non-terrestrial networks (NTN) are recognized to play a crucial role. It is in fact generally understood that the terrestrial network alone cannot provide the flexibility, scalability, adaptability, and coverage required to meet the above requirements, and the integration of the NTN component is a key enabler. In this framework, 3GPP has started to address the inclusion of technology enablers in the NR standard to support NTN. However, to fully exploit the potential of the NT component in an integrated terrestrial and NT architecture, several research and innovation challenges shall be addressed. In this paper, we first discuss the current development of NTN in 5G and then we present the vision of the role of NTN in B5G and 6G networks and we elaborate the corresponding research challenges.

AB  - This paper presents the advantages of a single-camera stereo omnidirectional system (SOS) in estimating egomotion in real-world environments. The challenge of applying omnidirectional stereo vision via a single camera is what separates our work from others. In practice, dynamic environments, deficient illumination, and poor textured surfaces result in the lack of features to track in the observable scene. As a consequence, this negatively affects the pose estimation of visual odometry systems, regardless of their field of view. We compare the tracking accuracy and stability of the single-camera SOS versus an RGB-D device under various real circumstances. Our quantitative evaluation is performed with respect to 3D ground-truth data obtained from a motion capture system. The datasets and experimental results we provide are unique due to the nature of our catadioptric omnistereo rig, and the situations in which we captured these motion sequences. We have implemented a tracking system with simple rules applicable to both synthetic and real scenes. Our implementation does not make any motion model assumptions, and it maintains a fixed configuration among the compared sensors. Our experimental outcomes confer the robustness in 3D metric visual odometry estimation that the single-camera SOS can achieve under normal and special conditions in which other perspective narrow view systems such as RGB-D cameras would fail.

AB  - This book introduces fundamental concepts of cyber resilience, drawing expertise from academia, industry, and government. Resilience is defined as the ability to recover from or easily adjust to shocks and stresses. Unlike the concept of security - which is often and incorrectly conflated with resilience -- resilience refers to the system's ability to recover or regenerate its performance after an unexpected impact produces a degradation in its performance. A clear understanding of distinction between security, risk and resilience is important for developing appropriate management of cyber threats. The book presents insightful discussion of the most current technical issues in cyber resilience, along with relevant methods and procedures. Practical aspects of current cyber resilience practices and techniques are described as they are now, and as they are likely to remain in the near term. The bulk of the material is presented in the book in a way that is easily accessible to non-specialists. Logical, consistent, and continuous discourse covering all key topics relevant to the field will be of use as teaching material as well as source of emerging scholarship in the field. A typical chapter provides introductory, tutorial-like material, detailed examples, in-depth elaboration of a selected technical approach, and a concise summary of key ideas.

AB  - Cloud computing emerged as a centralised paradigm that made “infinite” computing resources available on demand. Nevertheless, the ever-increasing computing capacities present on smart connected things and devices calls for the decentralisation of Cloud computing to avoid unnecessary latencies and fully exploit accessible computing capacities at the edges of the network. Whilst these decentralised Cloud models represent a significant breakthrough from a Cloud perspective, they are rooted in existing research areas such as Mobile Cloud Computing, Mobile Ad hoc Computing, and Edge computing. This article analyses the pre-existing works to determine their role in Decentralised Cloud and future computing development.

AB  - We investigate a linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control and sensing codesign problem, where one jointly designs sensing and control policies. Wefocus on the realistic case where the sensing design is selected among a finite set of available sensors, where each sensor is associated with a different cost (e.g., power consumption). We consider two dual problem instances: sensing-constrained LQG control, where one maximizes a control performance subject to a sensor cost budget, and minimum-sensing LQG control, where one minimizes a sensor cost subject to performance constraints. We prove that no polynomial time algorithm guarantees across all problem instances a constant approximation factor from the optimal. Nonetheless, wepresent the first polynomial time algorithms with per-instance suboptimality guarantees. To this end,we leverage a separation principle, which partially decouples the design of sensing and control. Then, we frame LQG codesign as the optimization of approximately supermodular set functions;we develop novel algorithms to solve the problems;and we prove original results on the performance of the algorithms and establish connections between their suboptimality and control-theoretic quantities. We conclude the article by discussing two applications, namely, sensing-constrained formation control and resource-constrained robot navigation.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to transform the human society toward becoming intelligent, convenient, and efficient with potentially enormous economic and environmental benefits. Reliability is one of the main challenges that must be addressed to enable this revolutionized transformation. Based on the layered IoT architecture, this article first identifies reliability challenges posed by specific enabling technologies of each layer. This article then presents a systematic synthesis and review of IoT reliability-related literature. Reliability models and solutions at four layers (perception, communication, support, and application) are reflected and classified. Despite the rich body of works performed, the IoT reliability research is still in its early stage. Challenging research problems and opportunities are then discussed in relation to current underexplored behaviors and future new aspects of evolving IoT system complexity and dynamics.

AB  - Recent advances in sensing, communication, and computing technologies have enabled the use of multirobot systems for practical applications such as surveillance, area mapping, and search and rescue. For such systems, a major challenge is to design decision rules that are real-time-implementable, require local information only, and guarantee some desired global performance. Distributed optimization provides a framework for designing such local decision-making rules for multirobot systems. In this article, we present a collection of selected results for distributed optimization for robot networks. We will focus on two special classes of problems: 1) real-time path planning for multirobot systems and 2) self-organization in multirobot systems using game-theoretic approaches. For multirobot path planning, we will present some recent approaches that are based on approximately solving distributed optimization problems over continuous and discrete domains of actions. The main idea underlying these approaches is that a variety of path planning problems can be formulated as convex optimization and submodular minimization problems over continuous and discrete action spaces, respectively. To generate local update rules that are efficiently implementable in real time, these approaches rely on approximate solutions to the global problems that can still guarantee some level of desired global performance. For game-theoretic self-organization, we will present a sampling of results for area coverage and real-time target assignment. In these results, the problems are formulated as games, and online updating rules are designed to enable teams of robots to achieve the collective objective in a distributed manner.

AB  - In recent years, the research community has witnessed an explosion of literature dealing with the mimicking of behavioral patterns and social phenomena observed in nature towards efficiently solving complex computational tasks. This trend has been especially dramatic in what relates to optimization problems, mainly due to the unprecedented complexity of problem instances, arising from a diverse spectrum of domains such as transportation, logistics, energy, climate, social networks, health and industry 4.0, among many others. Notwithstanding this upsurge of activity, research in this vibrant topic should be steered towards certain areas that, despite their eventual value and impact on the field of bio-inspired computation, still remain insufficiently explored to date. The main purpose of this paper is to outline the state of the art and to identify open challenges concerning the most relevant areas within bio-inspired optimization. An analysis and discussion are also carried out over the general trajectory followed in recent years by the community working in this field, thereby highlighting the need for reaching a consensus and joining forces towards achieving valuable insights into the understanding of this family of optimization techniques.

AB  - This comprehensive book examines a range of examples, prepared by a diverse group of academic and industry practitioners, which demonstrate how cloud-based simulation is being extensively used across many disciplines, including cyber-physical systems engineering. This book is a compendium of the state of the art in cloud-based simulation that instructors can use to inform the next generation. It highlights the underlying infrastructure, modeling paradigms, and simulation methodologies that can be brought to bear to develop the next generation of systems for a highly connected society. Such systems, aptly termed cyber-physical systems (CPS), are now widely used in e.g. transportation systems, smart grids, connected vehicles, industrial production systems, healthcare, education, and defense. Modeling and simulation (M&S), along with big data technologies, are at the forefront of complex systems engineering research. The disciplines of cloud-based simulation and CPS engineering are evolving at a rapid pace, but are not optimally supporting each other’s advancement. This book brings together these two communities, which already serve multi-disciplinary applications. It provides an overview of the simulation technologies landscape, and of infrastructure pertaining to the use of cloud-based environments for CPS engineering. It covers the engineering, design, and application of cloud simulation technologies and infrastructures applicable for CPS engineering. The contributions share valuable lessons learned from developing real-time embedded and robotic systems deployed through cloud-based infrastructures for application in CPS engineering and IoT-enabled society. The coverage incorporates cloud-based M&S as a medium for facilitating CPS engineering and governance, and elaborates on available cloud-based M&S technologies and their impacts on specific aspects of CPS engineering.

AB  - The lack of communication between local authorities, first aid responders, and the population that are present in a natural disaster area, represents critical aspects which can compromise relief operations in saving human lives. During natural disasters (earthquakes/tsunamis), the typical telecommunications network infrastructure in the affected area could be damaged or unfunctional. This can seriously compromise the efficiency of first aid operations. In this paper, we propose a device-to-device (D2D)-based framework which, starting from some basic information such as positions and battery level of victim’s devices, could provide communication from a disaster area towards a functional area. This framework, utilized by a base station located in a functional area, organizes users of disaster area into clusters of users and for each cluster select a gateway. This framework permits also, to evaluate the optimal transmission power for each gateway in order to maximize the energy efficiency in the area and to create a multi-hop path from the disaster area to relay node minimizing the end-to-end delay. The simulations results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms either random policy assignment and static policies assignment in both power allocation and routing path creations.

AB  - This article aims to present research conducted on the literature regarding multi-objective optimization for routing problems with environmental considerations, referred to here as Multi-objective Optimization for the Green Vehicle Routing Problem (MOOGVRP). A Brazilian database, CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel), was used to collect articles of general application, case studies and reviews in English starting from, since 2012. The terms “green vehicle routing problem” (GVRP), “pollution routing problem” (PRP), “vehicle routing problem in reverse logistics” (VRPRL) and “multi-objective” were used in the research protocol. Consequently, this study obtained 1,744 research results that, following the application of the filtering criterion, resulted in a sample of 76 articles from 38 journals, for which a bibliometric data (bibliometric review) survey was conducted. The originality of this article lies in how the research is presented, highlighting the results and details obtained through the survey, which may be considered of great academic importance in the sense of guiding the trends for future research.

AB  - One of the most important concerns in power system networks is harmonics, which is mainly developed with the huge usage of nonlinear loads and power electronic equipment. This harmonics leads to damage in the distribution system. This paper proposes an efficient hybrid approach with SHAPF for harmonic mitigation to maintain the PQ in the distribution system. An efficient hybrid approach is the joined execution of an EGOA and ANN named as EGOANN. The main aim of the proposed strategy is to improve the quality of power by mitigating the harmonics subject to the minimum THD. In the proposed approach, EGOA optimizes the dataset of fundamental and harmonic loop parameters such as Terminal voltage and DC voltage present in the SHAPF based on the load change and parameter variation of the system. In light of the accomplished dataset, ANN accurately predicts the parameters and produces optimized control signals. Finally, the proposed model is executed in the MATLAB/Simulink working platform, also includes the simulation results of a few test cases to maintain the PQ, and illustrates the superior performance of the proposed design philosophy. The simulation result shows that the harmonic distortion can be reduced to an acceptable level in response to the load change or parameter variation of the power system by the proposed EGOANN hybrid technique. Also, the proposed technique is more effective with less computation and reduces the complexity of the algorithm.

AB  - The development of the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks is gaining momentum to connect almost all aspects of life through the network with much higher speed, very low latency and ubiquitous connectivity. Due to its crucial role in our lives, the network must secure its users, components, and services. The security threat landscape of 5G has grown enormously due to the unprecedented increase in types of services and in the number of devices. Therefore, security solutions if not developed yet must be envisioned already to cope with diverse threats on various services, novel technologies, and increased user information accessible by the network. This paper outlines the 5G network threat landscape, the security vulnerabilities in the new technological concepts that will be adopted by 5G, and provides either solutions to those threats or future directions to cope with those security challenges. We also provide a brief outline of the post-5G cellular technologies and their security vulnerabilities which is referred to as future generations (XG) in this paper. In brief, this paper highlights the present and future security challenges in wireless networks, mainly in 5G, and future directions to secure wireless networks beyond 5G.

AB  - Mobile applications and social networks tend to enhance the needs for high‐quality content access. To address the expeditious growing demand for data services in 5G cellular networks, it is important to develop distribution techniques and an efficient content caching, aiming to significantly reduce redundant data transmission and, thus, improve the efficiency of the networks. In modern communication systems, caching has emerged as a vital tool for reducing peak data rates. It is anticipated that energy harvesting and self‐powered small base stations are the fundamental part of next‐generation cellular networks. However, uncertainties in energy are the main reason to adopt energy efficient power control schemes to reduce SBS energy consumption and ensure the quality of services for users. Using the edge cooperative caching such as energy efficient design can also be achievable, which reduces the usage of the capacity limited SBSs backhaul and the energy consumption. To support the huge power demand of cellular network, renewable energy harvesting technologies can be leveraged. In addition to this, power supply to the infrastructures is the main challenge to the mobile network operators (MNOs) especially in terms of economic optimum, sustainability, and green energy in developing countries for the growth of cellular networks. Renewable energy–based solutions for MNOs not only reduce the overall carbon dioxide emissions but also provide numerous profits.

AB  - A recently proposed approach to the rigorous engineering of collective adaptive systems is the aggregate computing paradigm, which operationalises the idea of expressing collective adaptive behaviour by a global perspective as a functional composition of dynamic computational fields (i.e., structures mapping a collection of individual devices of a collective to computational values over time). In this paper, we present FScaFi, a core language that captures the essence of exploiting field computations in mainstream functional languages, and which is based on a semantic model for field computations leveraging the novel notion of “computation against a neighbour”. Such a construct models expressions whose evaluation depends on the same evaluation that occurred on a neighbour, thus abstracting communication actions and, crucially, enabling deep and straightforward integration in the Scala programming language, by the ScaFi incarnation. We cover syntax and informal semantics of FScaFi, provide examples of collective adaptive behaviour development in ScaFi, and delineate future work.

AB  - Recent advances in information and communications cloud-based services hold the potential to overcome the scalability and complex maintenance limitations of traditional networks. Software Defined Networking (SDN) surfaced as a promising paradigm to mitigate such limitations while offering flexible networks management. Particularly, SDN separates the control plane from the data plane to achieve abstraction of lower-level functionality, hence, allowing more efficient network management and utilization. However, SDN suffers from various performance and scalability problems leading to significant research efforts on maximizing the scalability of the control plane. This paper aims at reviewing different SDN controller scalability, topology-based and mechanism-based approaches, as well as discussing and analyzing how they attempt to solve the scalability challenge. Furthermore, this paper elaborates on the promising research trends and challenges. Our insights are also discussed to stimulate further research efforts addressing the control plane scalability in SDN.

AB  - In this article, we put forward the substantial challenges in cyber resilience in the domain of autonomous systems and outline foundational solutions to address these challenges. These solutions fall into two broad themes: resilience-by-design and resilience-by-reaction. We use several application drivers from autonomous systems to motivate the challenges in cyber resilience and to demonstrate the benefit of the solutions. We focus on some autonomous systems in the near horizon (autonomous ground and aerial vehicles) and also a little more distant (autonomous rescue and relief). For resilience-by-design, we focus on design methods in software that are needed for our cyber systems to be resilient. In contrast, for resilience-by-reaction, we discuss how to make systems resilient by responding, reconfiguring, or recovering at runtime when failures happen. We also discuss the notion of adaptive execution to improve resilience, execution transparently and adaptively among available execution platforms (mobile/embedded, edge, and cloud). For each of the two themes, we survey the current state, and the desired state and ways to get there. We conclude the paper by looking at the research challenges we will have to solve in the short and the mid-term to make the vision of resilient autonomous systems a reality. This article came out of discussions that started at the NSF-sponsored Grand Challenges in Resilience Workshop held at Purdue in 2019 with the co-authors contributing to going into the depth of the issues and then this article.

AB  - The United Nations has declared 2018-2028 as the International Decade for Action on Water for Sustainable Development. This is a timely designation. In an increasingly thirsty world, the subject of forest-water interactions is of critical importance to the achievement of sustainability goals. The central underlying tenet of this book is that the hydrologic community can conduct better science and make a more meaningful impact to the world’s water crisis if scientists are: (1) better equipped to utilize new methods and harness big data from either or both high-frequency sensors and long-term research watersheds; and (2) aware of new developments in our process-based understanding of the hydrological cycle in both natural and urban settings. Accordingly, this forward-looking book delves into forest-water interactions from multiple methodological, statistical, and process-based perspectives (with some chapters featuring data sets and open-source R code), concluding with a chapter on future forest hydrology under global change. Thus, this book describes the opportunities of convergence in high-frequency sensing, big data, and open source software to catalyze more comprehensive understanding of forest-water interactions. The book will be of interest to researchers, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates in an array of disciplines, including hydrology, forestry, ecology, botany, and environmental engineering. The chapter “Cracking “Open” Technology in Ecohydrology” is available open access under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License via link.springer.com.

AB  - This proceedings book covers the theory, design and applications of computer networks, distributed computing and information systems. Today’s networks are evolving rapidly, and there are several developing areas and applications. These include heterogeneous networking supported by recent technological advances in power wireless communications, along with silicon integration of various functionalities such as sensing, communications, intelligence and actuations, which is emerging as a critically important disruptive computer class based on a new platform, networking structure and interface that enables novel, low-cost and high-volume applications. However, implemeting these applications has sometimes been difficult due to interconnection problems. As such, different networks need to collaborate, and wired and next-generation wireless systems need to be integrated in order to develop high-performance computing solutions to address the problems arising from these networks’ complexities. This ebook presents the latest research findings, as well as theoretical and practical perspectives on the innovative methods and development techniques related to the emerging areas of information networking and applications.

AB  - Performance analysis of object detection combined with post-processing schemes are challenging especially that the spatial resolution of images is low in wide-area aerial imagery. In this paper, we present the quantitative results of ten object detection algorithms combined with several post-processing schemes including filtered dilation, heuristic filtering, sieving and closing, a three-stage scheme which involves thresholding with respect to area and compactness, and the proposed scheme of median filtering, opening and closing, followed by linear Gaussian filtering with nonmaximum suppression. We verified the sieving and closing as well as the three-stage scheme display better Fβ-score and PASCAL value via four vehicle detection algorithms. We evaluated combinations of ten object detection and segmentation methods with two post-processing schemes by adopting a set of recent evaluation metrics, i.e., Jaccard Index (JI), Fbw measure, the structure similarity measure (SSIM) and the enhanced alignment measure (EAM). Automatic detection outputs are compared with their ground truth in low-resolution aerial datasets. Classified detection results are established on ten algorithms each combined with the selected post-processing schemes. We take two widely used datasets (VIVID and VEDAI) for performance analysis, compare the detections and time cost of each algorithm either without or with the proposed scheme, and verified our approach via replacing either datasets or algorithms. Quantitative evaluation under a set of enhanced measures proves our test with validity, efficiency, and accuracy.

AB  - Smart products supported by new step-changing technologies, such as Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, are now emerging in the market. Smart products are cyber physical systems with services through Internet connection. For example, smart vehicles equipped with advanced embedded intelligence are connected to other vehicles, people, and environment, and offer innovative data-driven services. Since smart products are software-intensive, data-driven, and service-conscious, their development clearly needs new capabilities underpinned by advanced tools, methods, and models. This paper reviews the status and trends of these emerging development technologies such as model-based systems engineering and digital twin.

AB  -  Cyber-physical systems theory offers a powerful framework for modeling, analyzing, and designing real engineering systems integrating communication, control, and computation functionalities (the cyber part) within a natural and/or man-made system governed by the laws of physics (the physical part). New methodological developments in cyber-physical systems theory are required by traditional application domains such as manufacturing, transportation, and energy systems, which are currently experiencing significant and – to some extent – revolutionary changes to address the needs of our modern society. The goal of this position paper is to provide the cyber-physical systems community, and especially young researchers, a clear view on what are research directions worth pursuing motivated by the challenges posed by modern applications.

AB  - This book explores fundamental scientific problems essential for autonomous cyber defense. Specific areas include: Game and control theory-based moving target defenses (MTDs) and adaptive cyber defenses (ACDs) for fully autonomous cyber operations; The extent to which autonomous cyber systems can be designed and operated in a framework that is significantly different from the human-based systems we now operate; On-line learning algorithms, including deep recurrent networks and reinforcement learning, for the kinds of situation awareness and decisions that autonomous cyber systems will require; Human understanding and control of highly distributed autonomous cyber defenses; Quantitative performance metrics for the above so that autonomous cyber defensive agents can reason about the situation and appropriate responses as well as allowing humans to assess and improve the autonomous system. This book establishes scientific foundations for adaptive autonomous cyber systems and ultimately brings about a more secure and reliable Internet. The recent advances in adaptive cyber defense (ACD) have developed a range of new ACD techniques and methodologies for reasoning in an adaptive environment. Autonomy in physical and cyber systems promises to revolutionize cyber operations. The ability of autonomous systems to execute at scales, scopes, and tempos exceeding those of humans and human-controlled systems will introduce entirely new types of cyber defense strategies and tactics, especially in highly contested physical and cyber environments. The development and automation of cyber strategies that are responsive to autonomous adversaries pose basic new technical challenges for cyber-security. This book targets cyber-security professionals and researchers (industry, governments, and military). Advanced-level students in computer science and information systems will also find this book useful as a secondary textbook.

AB  - This book explores and analyzes emerging innovations within today’s most cutting-edge science and technology (S&T) areas, which are cited as carrying the potential to revolutionize governmental structures, economies, and international security. Some have argued that such technologies will yield doomsday scenarios and that military applications of such technologies have even greater potential than nuclear weapons to radically change the balance of power. As the United States looks to the future – whether dominated by extremist groups co-opting advanced weapons in the world of globalized non-state actors or states engaged in persistent regional conflicts in areas of strategic interest – new adversaries and new science and technology will emerge. Choices made today that affect science and technology will impact how ably the US can and will respond. Chapters within the book look at the changing strategic environment in which security operations are planned and conducted; how these impact science and technology policy choices made today; and predictions of how science and technology may play a beneficial or deleterious role in the future. Some game changing technologies have received global attention, while others may be less well known; the new technologies discussed within this proposal, as well as future discoveries, may significantly alter military capabilities and may generate new threats against military and civilian sectors.

AB  - This article surveys emerging technologies related to pervasive edge computing (PEC) for industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) enabled by fifth-generation (5G) and beyond communication networks. PEC encompasses all devices that are capable of performing computational tasks locally, including those at the edge of the core network (edge servers co-located with 5G base stations) and in the radio access network (sensors, actuators, etc.). The main advantages of this paradigm are core network offloading (and benefits therefrom) and low latency for delay-sensitive applications (e.g., automatic control). We have reviewed the state-of-the-art in the PEC paradigm and its applications to the IIoT domain, which have been enabled by the recent developments in 5G technology. We have classified and described three important research areas related to PEC—distributed artificial intelligence methods, energy efficiency, and cyber security. We have also identified the main open challenges that must be solved to have a scalable PEC-based IIoT network that operates efficiently under different conditions. By explaining the applications, challenges, and opportunities, our paper reinforces the perspective that the PEC paradigm is an extremely suitable and important deployment model for industrial communication networks, considering the modern trend toward private industrial 5G networks with local operations and flexible management.

AB  - In this paper, we address the resilient group consensus of multi-agent networks in the presence of structured and unstructured Byzantine faults. In the case of structured Byzantine faults that feed different but structured values to the network, it is shown that non-faulty nodes can achieve group consensus without using any fault tolerant algorithm. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the network are derived so that the conventional consensus algorithm leads to group consensus values in the range determined by the initial values of the non-faulty nodes. In the presence of unstructured Byzantine faults, two fault tolerant algorithms are proposed to overcome the highly disruptive behaviour. Subsequently, convergence analysis of these algorithms is carried out by exploiting the robustness properties of the network. Finally, theoretical results are illustrated with several simulation examples.

AB  - Deployment of new optimized routing rules on routers are challenging, owing to the tight coupling of the data and control planes and a lack of global topological information. Due to the distributed nature of the traditional classical internet protocol networks, the routing rules and policies are disseminated in a decentralized manner, which causes looping issues during link failure. Software-defined networking (SDN) provides programmability to the network from a central point. Consequently, the nodes or data plane devices in SDN only forward packets and the complexity of the control plane is handed over to the controller. Therefore, the controller installs the rules and policies from a central location. Due to the central control, link failure identification and restoration becomes pliable because the controller has information about the global network topology. Similarly, new optimized rules for link recovery can be deployed from the central point. Herein, we review several schemes for link failure recovery by leveraging SDN while delineating the cons of traditional networking. We also investigate the open research questions posed due to the SDN architecture. This paper also analyzes the proactive and reactive schemes in SDN using the OpenDayLight controller and Mininet, with the simulation of application scenarios from the tactical and data center networks.

AB  - A key application of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm lies within industrial contexts. Indeed, the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, promises to revolutionize production and manufacturing through the use of large numbers of networked embedded sensing devices, and the combination of emerging computing technologies, such as Fog/Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology. Unsurprisingly, such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. To get an overview of the field, we deem it important to systematically survey the academic literature so far, and distill from it various security requirements as well as their popularity. This paper consists of two contributions: our primary contribution is a systematic review of the literature over the period 2011–2019 on IIoT Security, focusing in particular on the security requirements of the IIoT. Our secondary contribution is a reflection on how the relatively new paradigm of Fog computing can be leveraged to address these requirements, and thus improve the security of the IIoT.

AB  -  Internet of Things (IoT) is often envisioned as a paradigm shift from the traditional Internet to a scenario where all the “things” will be connected with the Internet. IoT forced the development of novel IoT standards to bring heterogeneous devices and protocols under one umbrella for the seamless interaction between them. To this end, a plethora of IoT standards and definitions have been proposed over the last decade. However, a common consensus over these standards and definitions is yet to be achieved. Another contemporary issue faced by IoT research community is the absence of a clear functional view of different IoT components working together in a cohesive manner to achieve the envisioned “connect everything” phenomena that serve the bigger objective of gathering the information and processing it for better decision making. Information gathering and processing bring the technologies such as “Cloud Computing” and “Big-Data” into the picture with IoT. In the line of energy efficient data processing, “Fog Computing” was introduced a few years back that is one of the key enablers of the contemporary industrial revolution often termed as “Industry 4.0”. However, there is still a need for a detailed study about how “Cloud computing”, “Big data”, and “Fog computing” fit together and act as building blocks of the much envisioned IoT. In this paper, we study the aforementioned issues in the following manner. First, we cover almost every IoT standard and definition available in the literature and propose an unbiased definition of IoT that takes into consideration the key objectives of various research groups. We also discuss the key components of IoT architecture and propose a functional view of IoT based on Weiser's model and information value loop that helps to specify a clear functionality of various IoT enablers. Following this, a detail discussion on information gathering and processing in IoT is supported by state-of-the-art and contemporary technologies such as Cloud computing and Fog computing respectively. We also propose a new perspective of IoT as social processes and a decentralized multi-agent system in order to address not so obvious future challenges that may arise as the research in IoT proceeds and new application domains are discovered. All in all, this survey provides a birds-eye view for the domain as well as introduce intricacies about the IoT functionality, enabling technologies, challenges, future research trends and directions. In the end, this paper discusses the state-of-the-art and contemporary simulations tools that can be used to implement the IoT based projects. All in all, this paper gives a much wider view of almost every technology related to IoT and its bigger objective of gathering more information and processing it according to the application requirement for better decision making.

AB  - This book provides a platform of scientific interaction between the three challenging and closely linked areas of ICT-enabled-application research and development: software intensive systems, complex systems and intelligent systems. Software intensive systems strongly interact with other systems, sensors, actuators, devices, other software systems and users. More and more domains are using software intensive systems, e.g. automotive and telecommunication systems, embedded systems in general, industrial automation systems and business applications. Moreover, web services offer a new platform for enabling software intensive systems. Complex systems research is focused on the overall understanding of systems rather than their components. Complex systems are characterized by the changing environments in which they interact. They evolve and adapt through internal and external dynamic interactions. The development of intelligent systems and agents, which are increasingly characterized by their use of ontologies and their logical foundations, offer impulses for both software intensive systems and complex systems. Recent research in the field of intelligent systems, robotics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive sciences are vital for the future development and innovation of software intensive and complex systems.

AB  - This book addresses the key security challenges in the big data centric computing and network systems, and discusses how to tackle them using a mix of conventional and state-of-the-art techniques. The incentive for joining big data and advanced analytics is no longer in doubt for businesses and ordinary users alike. Technology giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and companies like Uber, Airbnb, NVIDIA, Expedia, and so forth are continuing to explore new ways to collect and analyze big data to provide their customers with interactive services and new experiences. With any discussion of big data, security is not, however, far behind. Large scale data breaches and privacy leaks at governmental and financial institutions, social platforms, power grids, and so forth, are on the rise that cost billions of dollars. The book explains how the security needs and implementations are inherently different at different stages of the big data centric system, namely at the point of big data sensing and collection, delivery over existing networks, and analytics at the data centers. Thus, the book sheds light on how conventional security provisioning techniques like authentication and encryption need to scale well with all the stages of the big data centric system to effectively combat security threats and vulnerabilities. The book also uncovers the state of the art technologies like deep learning and blockchain which can dramatically change the security landscape in the big data era.

AB  - The book promotes a meaningful and appropriate dialogue and cross-disciplinary partnerships on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in governance and disaster management. The frequency and the cost of losses and damages due to disasters are rising every year. From wildfires to tsunamis, drought to hurricanes, floods to landslides combined with chemical, nuclear and biological disasters of epidemic proportions has increased human vulnerability and ecosystem sustainability. Life is not as it used to be and governance to manage disasters cannot be a business as usual. The quantum and proportion of responsibilities with the emergency services has increased many times to strain them beyond their human capacities. It’s time that the struggling disaster management services get supported and facilitated by new technology of combining AI and Machine Learning (ML) with Data Analytics Technologies (DAT) to serve people and government in disaster management. AI and ML have advanced to a state where they could be utilized for many operations in disaster risk reduction. Even though many disasters cannot be prevented and a number of them are blind natural disasters yet through an appropriate application of AI and ML quick predictions, vulnerability identification and classification of relief and rescue operations could be achieved. Prof. Dr T.V. Vijay Kumar is Professor and Dean, School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Delhi, India. Dr Keshav Sud is currently working as Senior Manager of Data Science at Keurig Dr Pepper where he is leading the development of recommendation engines.

AB  - This book presents scientific interactions between the three interwoven and challenging areas of research and development of future ICT-enabled applications: software, complex systems and intelligent systems. Software intensive systems heavily interact with other systems, sensors, actuators, and devices, as well as other software systems and users. More and more domains involve software intensive systems, e.g. automotive, telecommunication systems, embedded systems in general, industrial automation systems and business applications. Moreover, web services offer a new platform for enabling software intensive systems. Complex systems research focuses on understanding overall systems rather than their components. Such systems are characterized by the changing environments in which they act, and they evolve and adapt through internal and external dynamic interactions. The development of intelligent systems and agents features the use of ontologies, and their logical foundations provide a fruitful impulse for both software intensive systems and complex systems. Research in the field of intelligent systems, robotics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive sciences is a vital factor in the future development and innovation of software intensive and complex systems.

AB  - This book presents the latest trends in attacks and protection methods of Critical Infrastructures. It describes original research models and applied solutions for protecting major emerging threats in Critical Infrastructures and their underlying networks. It presents a number of emerging endeavors, from newly adopted technical expertise in industrial security to efficient modeling and implementation of attacks and relevant security measures in industrial control systems; including advancements in hardware and services security, interdependency networks, risk analysis, and control systems security along with their underlying protocols. Novel attacks against Critical Infrastructures (CI) demand novel security solutions. Simply adding more of what is done already (e.g. more thorough risk assessments, more expensive Intrusion Prevention/Detection Systems, more efficient firewalls, etc.) is simply not enough against threats and attacks that seem to have evolved beyond modern analyses and protection methods. The knowledge presented here will help Critical Infrastructure authorities, security officers, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) personnel and relevant researchers to (i) get acquainted with advancements in the field, (ii) integrate security research into their industrial or research work, (iii) evolve current practices in modeling and analyzing Critical Infrastructures, and (iv) moderate potential crises and emergencies influencing or emerging from Critical Infrastructures.

AB  - This book mainly discusses the most important issues in artificial intelligence-aided future networks, such as applying different ML approaches to investigate solutions to intelligently monitor, control and optimize networking. The authors focus on four scenarios of successfully applying machine learning in network space. It also discusses the main challenge of network traffic intelligent awareness and introduces several machine learning-based traffic awareness algorithms, such as traffic classification, anomaly traffic identification and traffic prediction. The authors introduce some ML approaches like reinforcement learning to deal with network control problem in this book. Traditional works on the control plane largely rely on a manual process in configuring forwarding, which cannot be employed for today's network conditions. To address this issue, several artificial intelligence approaches for self-learning control strategies are introduced. In addition, resource management problems are ubiquitous in the networking field, such as job scheduling, bitrate adaptation in video streaming and virtual machine placement in cloud computing. Compared with the traditional with-box approach, the authors present some ML methods to solve the complexity network resource allocation problems. Finally, semantic comprehension function is introduced to the network to understand the high-level business intent in this book. With Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), 5th Generation Wireless Systems (5G) development, the global network is undergoing profound restructuring and transformation. However, with the improvement of the flexibility and scalability of the networks, as well as the ever-increasing complexity of networks, makes effective monitoring, overall control, and optimization of the network extremely difficult. Recently, adding intelligence to the control plane through AI&ML become a trend and a direction of network development This book's expected audience includes professors, researchers, scientists, practitioners, engineers, industry managers, and government research workers, who work in the fields of intelligent network.

AB  - Is peace among nations a utopia? Some would say yes, others would say no. In fact, it depends on how one defines peace. Is it the absence of international conflict or war? Is it the absence of violence or fear of violence both at the national and the international levels? Better yet, isn’t violence embedded in our DNA, as a species? Aren’t we doomed to compete for resources, to constantly put our own survival instinct to work? There is a lot of moving parts in the concepts of war and peace, which make both notions ambivalent and, thus, create sort of a dichotomy. The origins of war date back from prehistoric times; and the causes of war are both endogenous and exogenous, meaning war has both biological and international roots. Acknowledging the ambivalence of conflict and peace, scholars – Aquinas being the first – have come up with the concept of Just war, which legitimizes war and armed humanitarian intervention, bringing to bear, in the process, the paradoxical natural of peacekeeping missions. The Utopian or the hopeful think that peace among nations is possible because there are numerous elements of hope for world peace such as: the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, globalization, diplomacy, and nuclear deterrence, to name a few. On the other hand, the dystopian or the skeptical think that the barriers to world peace are too serious for world peace to become a reality. They put forth the following: proliferation of nuclear weapons, geo-economics, terrorism, the global refugee crisis, and the profitability of arms sales and war itself, to name a few. This mix of optimism and pessimism tend to motivate some of us to consider rather the future of armed conflict instead of considering a pipe dream at both ends of the spectrum. This third category of people thinks that war and conflict will take place in a totally different environment: cyberspace. They think that future wars will not be positional but, instead, will be sub-national.

AB  - The functioning of important ecosystems, including high productivity seagrass beds, coral reefs, macro-algal reefs, mangroves, salt-marshes, needs to be balanced, and, in many cases, adverse trends need to be reversed, repaired, and offset. One of many solutions that is needed to achieve the below SDGs is the utilization of saline water and soil for the research, conservation and development of halophyte ecosystems. The scientific documentation—initiated and supported by UNESCO— provides information, data, conclusions, recommendations, answers and inspiration to two main questions: - How to use of the vast volume of saline waters, areas of saline soils, and the halophytes, without competing against agricultural lands, in support of food-security, clean-energy, jobs and economic growth? - What halophyte-biodiversity aspects need to be considered for ecosystem development, nature restoration and climate action? It is time to apply some of the innovations demonstrated in the previous volumes in the Tasks for Vegetation Science book series, to turn from experiments to long-term pilot studies. This is necessary in order to obtain solid scientific data for large-scale applications. Studying halophyte and sabkha ecosystems will contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Zero Hunger, Clean Water, Clean Energy, Climate Action, Economic Growth, Sustainable Communities and Biodiversity on land and below water. This book is the sixth and final volume in the Tasks for Vegetation Science book series, and it concludes the most comprehensive scientific documentation dealing with hypersaline ecosystems of the world.

It comprises important scientific research on the social, economic, and environmental pillars of sustainable mountain development and will serve as a basis for evidence-based decision-making to safeguard the environment and advance people’s well-being. The compiled content is based on the collective knowledge of over 300 leading researchers, experts and policymakers, brought together by the Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme (HIMAP) under the coordination of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). This assessment was conducted between 2013 and 2017 as the first of a series of monitoring and assessment reports, under the guidance of the HIMAP Steering Committee: Eklabya Sharma (ICIMOD), Atiq Raman (Bangladesh), Yuba Raj Khatiwada (Nepal), Linxiu Zhang (China), Surendra Pratap Singh (India), Tandong Yao (China) and David Molden (ICIMOD and Chair of the HIMAP SC). This First HKH Assessment Report consists of 16 chapters, which comprehensively assess the current state of knowledge of the HKH region, increase the understanding of various drivers of change and their impacts, address critical data gaps and develop a set of evidence-based and actionable policy solutions and recommendations. These are linked to nine mountain priorities for the mountains and people of the HKH consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals. This book is a must-read for policy makers, academics and students interested in this important region and an essentially important resource for contributors to global assessments such as the IPCC reports.

AB  - Modern humanity with some 5,000 years of recorded history has been experiencing growing pains, with no end in sight. It is high time for humanity to grow up and to transcend itself by embracing transhumanism. Transhumanism offers the most inclusive ideology for all ethnicities and races, the religious and the atheists, conservatives and liberals, the young and the old regardless of socioeconomic status, gender identity, or any other individual qualities. This book expounds on contemporary views and practical advice from more than 70 transhumanists. Astronaut Neil Armstrong said on the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, “One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” Transhumanism is the next logical step in the evolution of humankind, and it is the existential solution to the long-term survival of the human race.

AB  - The SAGE Handbook of Political Science presents a major retrospective and prospective overview of the discipline. Comprising three volumes of contributions from expert authors from around the world, the handbook aims to frame, assess and synthesize research in the field, helping to define and identify its current and future developments. It does so from a truly global and cross-area perspective. Chapters cover a broad range of aspects, from providing a general introduction to exploring important subfields within the discipline. Each chapter is designed to provide a state-of-the-art and comprehensive overview of the topic by incorporating cross-cutting global, interdisciplinary, and, where this applies, gender perspectives. The Handbook is arranged over seven core thematic sections: Part 1: Political Theory; Part 2: Methods; Part 3: Political Sociology; Part 4: Comparative Politics; Part 5: Public Policies and Administration; Part 6: International Relations; and Part 7: Major Challenges for Politics and Political Science in the 21st Century.

AB  - Historical geography is an active, theoretically-informed and vibrant field of study within modern geography, with strong interdisciplinary connections with the humanities and the social sciences. The SAGE Handbook of Historical Geography provides an international and in-depth overview of the field with chapters that examine the history, present condition and future significance of historical geography in relation to recent developments and current research. The Handbook is in two volumes, divided across nine parts. Volume One includes commentaries on the history and geography of historical geography, and reviews how historical geographers have considered the appropriation, management and representation of landscape, the changing geographies of property, land, money and financial capital, and the demographic, medical and political analysis of the world's growing and mobile population. Volume Two shows how historical geographers have made significant contributions to geopolitical debates about the relationships between nation-states and empires, to environmental challenges posed by human interaction with the natural world, to studies of the cultural, intellectual and political implications of modern science and technology, and to investigations of communicative action, artefacts, performances and representations. The final part reviews the methodological and ethical challenges of historical geography as a publicly engaged research practice. Part 1: Histories and Geographies; Part 2: Land and Landscapes; Part 3: Property and Money; Part 4: Population and Mobility; Part 5: Territory and Geopolitics; Part 6: Environment and Nature; Part 7: Science and Technology; Part 8: Meaning and Communication; and Part 9: Studies in Practice.

AB  - This reference work analyzes and assesses global environmental management techniques for environmental materials with a focus on their performance and economic benefits, proposing eco-friendly solutions and designating policies that will sustain the environment for future generations. It addresses management of environmental materials as not only a complex anthropogenic problem, but also as an expensive problem that needs to be managed sustainably. Simultaneously, it considers the environmental and economic benefits involved in the high levels of investment and operation costs required to develop effective materials collection and management systems in modern society.

AB  - This second edition of the multi-volume work goes beyond the comprehensive and systematic coverage of archaeology that appears in the first edition. The field of archaeology continues to grow and the collaborations between archaeologists and researchers in other areas - environmental studies, landscape studies, art history, demography, biomedicine, chemistry, museum specialists, etc. - continues to grow. This second edition builds on the massive collection of information and research from the first edition by adding new entries as well as updating the existing entries. The entries in this encyclopedia range from succinct summaries of specific sites and the scientific aspects of archaeological enquiry to detailed discussions of archaeological concepts, theories and methods, and from investigations into the social, ethical and political dimensions of archaeological practice to biographies of leading archaeologists from throughout the world. The different forms of archaeology are explored, along with the techniques used for each and the challenges, concerns and issues that face archaeologists today. This compendium is both a print reference and an online reference work. One of the encyclopedia’s major innovations is that it harnesses the capabilities of an online environment, enhancing both the presentation and dissemination of information. Most particularly, the continuous updating allowed by an online environment should ensure that the Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology is a definitive reference work for archaeology and archaeologists.
