AB  - The application of multi-objective optimisation to evolutionary robotics is receiving increasing attention. A survey of the literature reveals the different possibilities it offers to improve the automatic design of efficient and adaptive robotic systems, and points to the successful demonstrations available for both task-specific and task-agnostic approaches (i.e., with or without reference to the specific design problem to be tackled). However, the advantages of multi-objective approaches over single-objective ones have not been clearly spelled out and experimentally demonstrated. This paper fills this gap for task-specific approaches: starting from well-known results in multi-objective optimisation, we discuss how to tackle commonly recognised problems in evolutionary robotics. In particular, we show that multi-objective optimisation (i) allows evolving a more varied set of behaviours by exploring multiple trade-offs of the objectives to optimise, (ii) supports the evolution of the desired behaviour through the introduction of objectives as proxies, (iii) avoids the premature convergence to local optima possibly introduced by multi-component fitness functions, and (iv) solves the bootstrap problem exploiting ancillary objectives to guide evolution in the early phases. We present an experimental demonstration of these benefits in three different case studies: maze navigation in a single robot domain, flocking in a swarm robotics context, and a strictly collaborative task in collective robotics.

AB  - Control of a multi-spacecraft constellation is a topic of significant inquiry, at present. This paper presents and evaluates a command architecture for a multi-spacecraft mission. It combines swarm techniques with a decentralized / local decision making architecture (which uses a set of shared blackboards for coordination) and demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. Under this approach, the Blackboard software architecture is used to facilitate data sharing between craft as part of a resilient hierarchy and the swarm techniques are used to coordinate activity. The paper begins with an overview of prior work on the precursor command technologies and then presents five command architectures for comparison purposes. Then, it presents a qualitative analysis of these techniques, followed by a quantitative analysis which characterizes the constellation's performance across a variety of prospective scenarios including normal operations, several mission scenarios which limit communications, operations in an intentionally communications-denied environment and operations across a variety of craft failure scenarios. From performance analysis, the utility of the techniques is analyzed.

AB  - Distributed Adaptive Real-Time (DART) systems are interconnected and collaborating systems that continuously must satisfy guaranteed and highly critical requirements (e.g., collision avoidance), while at the same time adapt, smartly, to achieve best-effort and low-critical application requirements (e.g., protection coverage) when operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. This short paper introduces our architecture and approach to engineering a DART system so that we achieve high assurance in its runtime behavior against a set of formally specified requirements. It describes our technique to: (i) ensure asymmetric timing protection between high- and low-critical threads on each node in the DART system, and (ii) verify that the self-adaptation within, and coordination between, the nodes and their interaction with the physical environment do not violate high and low criticality requirements. We present our ongoing research to integrate advances in model-based engineering with compositional analysis techniques to formally verify safety-critical properties demanded in safety-conscious domains such as aviation and automotive; and introduce our DART model problem to demonstrate of our engineering approach.

AB  - In the world, the territorial risk is increasingly characterized by joint presence of multiple risks, both natural and anthropogenic. Natural hazards include: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods, landslides, coastal erosion, subsidence, water shortages and avalanches. The major anthropic risks are: terrorism, CBRN risk, big event and urban crisis, the industrial-technological risk, the interface and forest fire risk, the environmental risk and also health risk. Today, the modern society are formed by a great complexity of networks and systems. Continuous supply of essential services (i.e. electricity, transport, health care, emergency, banking and financial system) is increasingly a fundamental and concrete need. In all industrialized countries, this complexity has been shown to have a significant effects on the welfare of citizens, social organization, economy and territorial security. In fact, a partial or total detriment of the networks and systems' capacity can have a debilitating impact on society, on defense and security both locally and nationally for the Domino effect. Obviously, if the cities are densely populated this problem is amplified. Finally, the interdependence between networks and urban system is made possible by the rapid growth and integration of infrastructure and telecommunications. If this has improved the lives of citizens, has also made the entire system more delicate and vulnerable. To mitigate this risk profile and optimizing the prevention and mitigation actions and to counteract the consequences of such events, there are some key elements: i) monitoring and control of infrastructures and territory, ii) the adoption of appropriate emergency and contingency plans, iii) the increasing the resilience, iv) the implementation of security policies for public/private partnership but overall, v) the proper management of information. This is important to achieve a holistic, integrated, comprehensive and multidimensional approach during crisis or e emergencies. To achieve this new way to deal with the crisis/emergency event, we must take both a technological and organizational change and evolution of the general architecture of the system. So we can built an homogenous and collaborative environment that allow us to create an institutional, geographical, technical and operational connectivity and the concretization of a rational, consistent and interoperable response. Therefore, we need to built a integrated chain of acquisition, organization and management of data and information coming from the entire territory passing through the use of an integration strategy among space, airborne and ground data acquisition systems. In this way, we can achieve a high level of detail. This is allowed because the data, the information and images of the event, may not only be manipulated, analyzed and displayed, but also converted and used as data input to system such as Geographic Information System (GIS) and Common Operational Picture (COP). So, the decision makers can get an overview of operational framework of the event and may also share this vision with different institutions, structures and organizations. They can be supported in the characterization and management of crisis or emergency and also in collaborative planning.

AB  - This article presents an approach for decision-making in support of the control of an autonomous system of multiple tiers of robots (e.g., satellite, aerial and ground) based on the Blackboard architectural style. Under the proposed approach, the system evaluates prospective approaches for goal satisfaction (identified by user selected final rules), identifies the lowest-cost solution and determines the best path to achieving the goal, via the analysis of the Blackboard rule and action set. Two different approaches to this rule and action path generation are discussed. This article presents the proposed Blackboard-style architecture for autonomous multi-tier control and describes its implementation. The benefits and drawbacks of the Blackboard-style approach are analysed, its extrapolation to the control of multiple heterogeneous craft is presented and the tradeoffs between the two approaches to rule-path generation are assessed.

AB  - The past decade has seen a proliferation in the use of robots in a broad range of complex domains, such as urban search and rescue, military operations (including explosive ordnance disposal and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), scientific exploration in underwater and space expeditions, law enforcement (e.g., bomb squads), manufacturing, and health care (e.g., telerobotic surgery). Remotely controlled ground, aerial, sea-surface, and underwater robotic vehicles are serving as tools to safely extend the sensory and psychomotor capabilities of humans to remote environments while keeping humans safe. More importantly, with the ever-increasing technological sophistication in their design and capabilities, robots are becoming more than mere tools. They now can be seen as quasi–team members whose tasks and behaviors must be integrated with the task requirements and expectations of their human teammates. Yet without the necessary research base to inform design, sizeable investments will likely be made into developing robotic systems that are ineffective or, at best, not optimal. Toward this end, the goal of this two-part special issue is to present examples of the latest research on human-robot interaction that demonstrate how theories and empirical findings can be translated into practical, useful guidance for improving human-robot team performance across various domains.

AB  - The flexibilities from controllable distributed energy resources (DERs) offer the opportunities to mitigate some of the operation problems in the power distribution grid. The provision of system services requires the aggregation and coordination of their flexibilities, in order to obtain the flexible capacity of large scale. In this paper, a hierarchical controller is presented to activate the aggregation, and tries to obtain a global optimum of the grid operation. A distribution grid with large penetration of highly varying generation or load is under the risk that the voltage quality delivered to the end users is very poor. Hence, a coordinated voltage control function is investigated given such control hierarchy utilizing the flexibilities from the DER units to obtain an optimal voltage profile along the distribution feeder. The results are two folded: the controller enables the efficient aggregation and dispatch, and it simplifies the optimization complexity; the involvement of DER flexibilities in voltage services can significantly improve the voltage quality and reduce the grid power loss without additional regulating devices.

AB  - Scaling down the size and mass of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) increases their agility and their ability to operate in tight formations. In addition, smaller robots are safer and, as we will show in this paper, more robust to collisions. This paper addresses the development of a pico quadrotor measuring 11 cm from tip to tip, with a mass of 25g. To increase the robustness of the robot to collisions, the vehicle is equipped with a 2 gram carbon fiber cage that protects it from impact velocities in excess of $4\,\, m/s$ and also permits recovery after collisions. We present the design of the electrical, mechanical and computational elements, as well as experimental results demonstrating trajectory following with feedback from an external motion camera system, recovery from collisions with walls and other robots, and formation flight.

AB  - Research in micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) construction, control, and high-density power sources is enabling swarms of MAVs as a new class of mobile sensing systems. For efficient operation, such systems must adapt to dynamic environments, cope with uncertainty in sensing and control, and operate with limited resources. We propose a novel system architecture based on a hive-drone model that simplifies the functionality of an individual MAV to a sequence of sensing and actuation commands with no in-field communication. This decision simplifies the hardware and software complexity of individual MAVs and moves the complexity of coordination entirely to a central hive computer. We present Karma, a system for programming and managing MAV swarms. Through simulation and testbed experiments we demonstrate how applications in Karma can run on limited resources, are robust to individual MAV failure, and adapt to changes in the environment.

AB  - In this paper, we compare the proactive MANET routing schemes of OLSR and OSPF-MDR via high-fidelity simulation, and consider their suitability for large-scale airborne networks. A successful MANET routing scheme must be bandwidth efficient and robust to frequent topology changes. To assess the two protocols, we simulate them in networks with up to 400 mobile nodes, under a variety of network densities. We evaluate them on the basis of the amount of routing overhead generated, the rate of successful packet delivery, and the time it takes until all of the routing tables converge. We find that OLSR requires up to an order magnitude higher router overhead than OSPF-MDR, while providing only a marginal benefit in packet delivery success rates. The largest difference between the two protocols is the time it takes for their routing tables to converge in the presence of packet loss. OLSR has consistent convergence times for networks of all sizes, while the convergence time of OSPF-MDR increases with network size.

AB  - Defense systems provide a rich, challenging, and critical environment for usability. Complexity, severity, and life-critical importance place them necessarily on the cutting edge of usability. This chapter describes the broad range of defense missions, operators, and operating environments and relates these to key dimensions of usability. It illustrates this concretely with two case examples: ground control stations for remotely piloted aircraft and air traffic management systems. The chapter explores how, in both these cases, advances in machine autonomy and human control promise to enhance operator situational awareness and control, but not without challenges. The chapter next provides guidelines for effective usability engineering. These include: 1) require usability as a key performance parameter, 2) architect and design systems and operations that incorporate affordances and fault tolerance, 3) employ standards to increase learnability and interoperability, 4) instrument environments to tailor usability, and 5) assess effects. The chapter concludes by identifying the remaining challenges.Keywords: defense systems, usability, remotely piloted aircraft, air traffic management, autonomy, aviation, human control, situational awareness, cognitive overload, control

AB  - Unmanned systems are proving to have a significant impact on warfare worldwide. The true value of these systems is not to provide a direct human replacement, but rather to extend and complement human capability in a number of ways. These systems extend human reach by providing potentially unlimited persistent capabilities without degradation due to fatigue or lack of attention. Unmanned systems offer the warfighter more options and flexibility to access hazardous environments, work at small scales, or react at speeds and scales beyond human capability. With proper design of bounded autonomous capabilities, unmanned systems can also reduce the high cognitive load currently placed on operators/supervisors. Moreover, increased autonomy can enable humans to delegate those tasks that are more effectively done by computer, including synchronizing activities between multiple unmanned systems, software agents and warfighters thus freeing humans to focus on more complex decision making.

Based on recent advances in complex networks, this paper aims to provide some new methodologies to study some fundamental problems in smart grids. In particular, it summarises some results for networks properties, distributed control and optimisation, and pinning control in complex networks and tries to reveal how these new technologies can be applied in smart grids.

AB  - A monocular vision-based approach to indoor autonomous navigation for an off-the-shelf, low-cost Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) quadcopter is presented. Our approach is fully automated and relies on the extraction and analysis of the visual contours of the surrounding physical environment to successfully steer the MAV in hallways and to turn at intersections. All image analysis and processing necessary for deriving and controlling the flight trajectory take place off-board on a system external to the MAV. This permits the use of sophisticated multithreaded real-time algorithms that do not limit the speed of the drone. Furthermore, due to the elimination of on-board processing and possibly the use of additional sensors for realizing such autonomy, stock drones can be used and flight times realized on a single charge remain unaffected. We describe a prototype implementation on a Parrot AR.Drone quadcopter and initial results for autonomous navigation in a structured indoor environment that establishes the viability of the approach.

AB  - As a component of the Department of Homeland Security and the departments lead for maritime security, the Coast Guard is charged with executing the United States domestic maritime anti-terrorism program. It is critical that Coast Guard policy, plans, and tactics maintain pace with the ever-changing risks associated with terrorism. This thesis examines alternative analysis red teaming and its potential value to the Coast Guard. Specifically, it seeks to answer how red teaming can be leveraged to enhance the value of domestic maritime anti-terrorism activities. The research reviews elements of the maritime domain and principles of red teaming, and proposes and provides implementation recommendations for a terrorism red teaming program for the domestic maritime domain. The study revealed that a red team program would be value added to the Coast Guard for domestic maritime anti-terrorism programs. Leveraging the concept of a minimal viable program, the thesis proposes a red team program and strategy to implement the program within the U.S. Coast Guard. The suggested program would be comprised of three elements: physical red teaming, identification of future attack scenarios, and policy red teaming. The thesis further provides insight into the implementation of these programs and suggests a minimal viable program approach to establishing a terrorism red teaming program for the domestic maritime domain.

AB  - We address the potential for a truly universal set of integrated wireless communication services, energy management, and control services for a next-generation of National Institute of Standards and Technology microgrid standards. Our approach uses cloud computing data center as the central communication and optimization infrastructure supporting a cognitive radio network of AMI meters which we label netbook advance metering infrastructure (Net-AMI). The Net-AMI is a novel low cost infrastructure of AMI meters that operate akin to netbooks with wireless transceiver that access to cloud data center energy services, cognitive radio services, and wireless communication services. Access occurs via cognitive radios channels. We claim that this solution solves the important problem in smart grid systems of how to develop an extensible, persistent, smart grid information network with a lifespan equivalent to that of most power systems (20–30 years). By persistence, we imply always operable, entirely software upgradeable, and independent of cellular networks. Our system is extensible and can easily handle thousands of variations in power systems, communication protocols, control, and energy optimization protocols. We formulate necessary link analysis and optimum scheduling of downlink and uplink Net-AMI packets in a multiuser cognitive radio environment.

AB  - In recent years, robots have been built based on cognitive architecture which has been developed to model human cognitive ability. The cognitive architecture can be a basis for intelligence technology to generate robot intelligence. In this edited book the robot intelligence is classified into six categories: cognitive intelligence, social intelligence, behavioral intelligence, ambient intelligence, collective intelligence and genetic intelligence. This classification categorizes the intelligence of robots based on the different aspects of awareness and the ability to act deliberately as a result of such awareness. This book aims at serving researchers and practitioners with a timely dissemination of the recent progress on robot intelligence technology and its applications, based on a collection of papers presented at the 1st International Conference on Robot Intelligence Technology and Applications (RiTA), held in Gwangju, Korea, December 16-18, 2012. For a better readability, this edition has the total 101 papers grouped into 3 chapters: Chapter I: Cognitive Intelligence, Social Intelligence and Behavioral Intelligence, Chapter II: Ambient Intelligence, Collective Intelligence and Genetic Intelligence, Chapter III: Intelligent Robot Technologies and Applications.

AB  - The expansion of human capability through emerging technologies resulting from converging developments in advanced robotics, information technology, and the cognitive sciences has served as a point of fascination for literature and the box office alike, but it also is transforming the landscape of contemporary medicine, science, and technology. Developments in robotics over the past few decades in manufacturing, shipping, and military applications have already begun to profoundly reshape these industries. Similarly, the healthcare, service industries, and the transportation sector are poised to join this robotic revolution through the increasing sophistication of surgical robots and other robotic caregivers. Given the vast potential of this form of emerging technologies, this entry explores the field of robotic technology across a wide range of industries and the subsequent discourse of robot ethics to consider if there are inherent concerns or dangers in the utilization of these emerging technologies. Additional attention is given to ethical considerations and social implications of these technologies, as well as to legal and other policy questions raised with respect to regulating robotics for the public good.

AB  - Optimal design techniques have proven to be an effective systems engineering tool. Using systems architecture as the foundation, this paper explores the use of mixed variable optimization models for synthesizing and evaluating disaggregated space system concepts. Model-based conceptual design (MBCD) techniques are used to identify and assess system architectures based upon estimated system cost and performance trades. The Disaggregated Integral System Concept Optimization (DISCO) methodology is introduced, and then applied to a space-based, fire detection mission. Several results are obtained that indicate potential cost effectiveness gains from the concept design optimization of a fire detection mission. The general methodology has broad applicability for MBCD of systems, but is particularly useful for dynamic, nonlinear disaggregated space systems.

AB  - Large naval surface combatants are potentially held at risk by adversarial anti-access aerial denial (A2AD) weapon systems. To mitigate that risk we propose a distributed surface force concept, which relies on a cost-effective small surface combatant (SSC) capable of augmenting current forces in the 2025 2030 timeframe. We show that dispensing offensive and defensive power onto numerous smaller platforms has several advantages, including a more resilient force structure, greater number of ships, and fiscal cost savings. After employing the systems engineering process tailored to the problem to understand requirements and alternatives, a single mission SSC adapted to anti-surface warfare (ASUW) emerged as the solution. The SSC is conceptually employed in an armada composed of existing naval forces, which provide a protective shield against a multi-threat enemy force. The Armada is nominally composed of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, Littoral Combat Ships and SSCs. The SSC'As capabilities include eight anti-ship cruise missiles with a range of 90 nautical miles, speed greater than 25 knots, and organic detection and classification range of at least 60 nautical miles.

AB  - This book constitutes the proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Wireless and Satellite Services, WiSATS 2015, held in Bradford, UK, in July 2015. The conference was formerly known as the International Conference on Personal Satellite Services (PSATS) mainly covering topics in the satellite domain. As the scope of the conference widened to include wireless systems, the conference was renamed to WiSATS. The 29 revised papers were presented at the conference in three technical sessions and one special session on “Network Coding for Satellites”. WiSATS 2015 also hosted two workshops along with the main conference: The first workshop, Communication Applications in Smart Grid (CASG 2015), focused on the merging area of using communication technology within the electricity power grid for smart monitoring and control. The second workshop, Advanced Next-Generation Broadband Satellite Systems (BSS 2015), focused on the use of satellite systems for providing next-generation broadband services.

AB  - Cloud Connectivity and Embedded Sensory Systems by: Lambert Spaanenburg Hendrik Spaanenburg Sensory systems are meant to create awareness in space and time. They may be measuring the presence of an object or a condition, characterizing an object stream or a situational pattern, or even detect abnormalities that are to occur. This book provides new theory on the design of wireless sensor networks, based on concepts developed for large-scale, distributed computing environments known as “clouds.” It provides a single-source entry into the world of intelligent sensory systems, with a step-by-step discussion of building case studies that capture the requirements, taking into account practical limitations of creating ambient intelligence. The reader will not only achieve a better understanding of sensory clouds, but is also guided by examples of how to design such networks, taking the typical characteristics of diverse application areas into account. •Offers readers a single-source entry into the world of cloud-centric, embedded intelligent sensory systems; •Presents sensory networks in the context of “cloud computing”; •Promotes the notion of migrating software on virtualized hardware; •Emphasizes the role of redundant network communication and computation to optimize safety and security; •Distinguishes between cloud, swarm and flock computing, in order to make the extended network more intelligent and therefore less dependent on the quality of the individual sensors.

AB  - Collaboration in highly distributed organizations of people, robots, and autonomous systems is and must be revolutionized by engineering augmentation. The aim is to augment humans’ abilities at work and, through this augmentation, improve organizations’ abilities to accomplish their missions. This book establishes the theoretical foundations and design principles of collaborative e-Work, e-Business and e-Service, their models and applications, design and implementation techniques. The fundamental premise is that without effective e-Work and e-Services, the potential of emerging activities, such as e-Commerce, virtual manufacturing, tele-robotic medicine, automated construction, smart energy grid, cyber-supported agriculture, and intelligent transportation cannot be fully materialized. Typically, workers and managers of such value networks are frustrated with complex information systems, originally designed and built to simplify and improve performance. Even if the human-computer interface for such systems is well designed, the information and task overloads can be overwhelming. Effective delivery of expected outcomes may not occur. Challenges and emerging solutions in the context of the recently developed CCT, Collaborative Control Theory, are described, with emphasis on issues of computer-supported and communication-enabled integration, coordination and augmented collaboration. Research results and analyses of engineering design methods and complex systems management techniques are explained and illustrated.

AB  - Dancing humanoids, robotic art installations, and music generated by mathematically precise methods are no longer science fiction; in fact they are the subject of this book.  This first-of-its-kind anthology assembles technical research that makes such creations possible.  In order to mechanize something as enigmatic and personal as dance, researchers must delve deeply into two distinct academic disciplines: control theory and art.  Broadly, this research uses techniques from the world of art to inspire methods in control, enables artistic endeavours using advanced control theory, and aids in the analysis of art using metrics devised by a systems theoretic approach.  To ensure that artistic influences are well represented, the individual chapters are focused so that they relate their contribution to the arts meaningfully and explicitly. Specially composed introductions set up the contributions either in terms of inspiration by artistic principles or their contribution to the arts through new analysis tools. To facilitate this, the majority of the chapters are authored jointly by experts in control theory and by artists, including dancers, choreographers, puppeteers, and painters. Connections between controls and art then permeate the text so that these important relationships play a central role in the book. Controls and Art surveys current projects in this area—including a disco dancing robot, a reactive museum exhibit, and otherworldly music—and illuminates open problems and topics for research in this emerging interdisciplinary field. It will draw attention both from experts in robotics and control interested in developing the artistic side of their creations and from academics studying dance, theater, music and the visual arts with an interest in avant-garde means of production.

AB  - Space Security involves the use of space (in particular communication, navigation, earth observation, and electronic intelligence satellites) for military and security purposes on earth and also the maintenance of space (in particular the earth orbits) as safe and secure areas for conducting peaceful activities. The two aspects can be summarized as "space for security on earth" and “the safeguarding of space for peaceful endeavors.” The Handbook will provide a sophisticated, cutting-edge resource on the space security policy portfolio and the associated assets, assisting fellow members of the global space community and other interested policy-making and academic audiences in keeping abreast of the current and future directions of this vital dimension of international space policy. The debate on coordinated space security measures, including relevant 'Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures,' remains at a relatively early stage of development. The book offers a comprehensive description of the various components of space security and how these challenges are being addressed today. It will also provide a number of recommendations concerning how best to advance this space policy area, given the often competing objectives of the world's major space-faring nations. The critical role to be played by the United States and Europe as an intermediary and "middle diplomat" in promoting sustainable norms of behavior for space will likewise be highlighted. In providing a global and coherent analytical approach to space security today, the Handbook focuses on four areas that together define the entire space security area: policies, technologies, applications, and programs. This structure will assure the overall view of the subject from its political to its technical aspects. Internationally recognized experts in each of the above fields contribute, with their analytical synthesis assured by the section editors.

AB  - This new handbook provides a comprehensive overview of the issues facing naval strategy and security in the twenty-first century. Featuring contributions from some of the world’s premier researchers and practitioners in the field of naval strategy and security, this handbook covers naval security issues in diverse regions of the world, from the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean to the Arctic and the piracy-prone waters off East Africa’s coast. It outlines major policy challenges arising from competing claims, transnational organized crime and maritime terrorism, and details national and alliance reactions to these problems. While this volume provides detailed analyses on operational, judicial, and legislative consequences that contemporary maritime security threats pose, it also places a specific emphasis on naval strategy. With a public very much focused on the softer constabulary roles naval forces play (such as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, naval diplomacy, maintenance of good order at sea), the overarching hard-power role of navies has been pushed into the background. In fact, navies and seapower have been notably absent from many recent academic discussions and deliberations of maritime security. This handbook provides a much-desired addition to the literature for researchers and analysts in the social sciences on the relationship between security policy and military means on, under, and from the sea. It comprehensively explains the state of naval security in this maritime century and the role of naval forces in it. This book will be of much interest to students of naval security and naval strategy, security studies and IR, as well as practitioners in the field. PART I: Context and Concepts 1.

AB  - Cyberspace is everywhere in today’s world and has significant implications not only for global economic activity, but also for international politics and transnational social relations.  This compilation addresses for the first time the “cyberization” of international relations - the growing dependence of actors in IR on the infrastructure and instruments of the internet, and the penetration of cyberspace into all fields of their activities. The volume approaches this topical issue in a comprehensive and interdisciplinary fashion, bringing together scholars from disciplines such as IR, security studies, ICT studies and philosophy as well as experts from  everyday cyber-practice. In the first part, concepts and theories are presented to shed light on the relationship between cyberspace and international relations, discussing implications for the discipline and presenting fresh and innovative theoretical approaches. Contributions in the second part  focus on specific empirical fields of activity (security, economy, diplomacy, cultural activity, transnational communication, critical infrastructure, cyber espionage, social media, and more) and address emerging challenges and prospects for international politics and relations.

AB  - Few subjects have caught the attention of the entire world as much as those dealing with natural hazards. The first decade of this new millennium provides a litany of tragic examples of various hazards that turned into disasters affecting millions of individuals around the globe. The human losses (some 225,000 people) associated with the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the economic costs (approximately 200 billion USD) of the 2011 Tohoku Japan earthquake, tsunami and reactor event, and the collective social impacts of human tragedies experienced during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 all provide repetitive reminders that we humans are temporary guests occupying a very active and angry planet. Any examples may have been cited here to stress the point that natural events on Earth may, and often do, lead to disasters and catastrophes when humans place themselves into situations of high risk. Few subjects share the true interdisciplinary dependency that characterizes the field of natural hazards. From geology and geophysics to engineering and emergency response to social psychology and economics, the study of natural hazards draws input from an impressive suite of unique and previously independent specializations. Natural hazards provide a common platform to reduce disciplinary boundaries and facilitate a beneficial synergy in the provision of timely and useful information and action on this critical subject matter. As social norms change regarding the concept of acceptable risk and human migration leads to an explosion in the number of megacities, coastal over-crowding and unmanaged habitation in precarious environments such as mountainous slopes, the vulnerability of people and their susceptibility to natural hazards increases dramatically. Coupled with the concerns of changing climates, escalating recovery costs, a growing divergence between more developed and less developed countries, the subject of natural hazards remains on the forefront of issues that affect all people, nations, and environments all the time. This treatise provides a compendium of critical, timely and very detailed information and essential facts regarding the basic attributes of natural hazards and concomitant disasters. The Encyclopedia of Natural Hazards effectively captures and integrates contributions from an international portfolio of almost 300 specialists whose range of expertise addresses over 330 topics pertinent to the field of natural hazards. Disciplinary barriers are overcome in this comprehensive treatment of the subject matter. Clear illustrations and numerous color images enhance the primary aim to communicate and educate. The inclusion of a series of unique “classic case study” events interspersed throughout the volume provides tangible examples linking concepts, issues, outcomes and solutions. These case studies illustrate different but notable recent, historic and prehistoric events that have shaped the world as we now know it. They provide excellent focal points linking the remaining terms in the volume to the primary field of study. This Encyclopedia of Natural Hazards will remain a standard reference of choice for many years.

AB  - In Obstructive Marketing, Maitland Hyslop deals with a very negative kind of activity which embraces activities, legal or otherwise, designed to prevent or restrict the distribution of a product or service, temporarily or permanently, against the wishes of the product manufacturer, service provider or customer. When the author defined this phenomenon as Obstructive Marketing and started to research it more than a decade ago, it was seen as a valid concept that was perhaps ahead of its time. The World has moved on and in the era of globalization a study of this negative aspect of marketing is now required. Obstructive Marketing is now seen as the business equivalent of asymmetric warfare, which is increasingly understood because the rise of the South and East at the expense of the North and West has brought some Obstructive Marketing stratagems into sharp focus. Using the author’s own research, this book explains what Obstructive Marketing is and why it is not called Anti-Marketing. The author explains who practises Obstructive Marketing, where, when and how; and why businesses are particularly vulnerable when entering new markets and engaging in change and innovation. Intriguing concepts such as cultural risk are illuminated along with formal links between Obstructive Marketing, asymmetric warfare and terrorism. This all leads to identification of the need for a strong Government/Business partnership to counter the effects of this darkest kind of marketing.

AB  - Convergence of knowledge and technology for the benefit of society (CKTS) is the core opportunity for progress in the 21st century, based on five principles: (1) the interdependence of all components of nature and society, (2) enhancement of creativity and innovation through evolutionary processes of convergence that combine existing principles, and divergence that generates new ones, (3) decision analysis for research and development based on system-logic deduction, (4) higher-level cross-domain languages to generate new solutions and support transfer of new knowledge, and (5) vision-inspired basic research embodied in grand challenges. Solutions are outlined for key societal challenges, including creating new industries and jobs, improving lifelong wellness and human potential, achieving personalized and integrated healthcare and education, and securing a sustainable quality of life for all. This report provides a ten-year “NBIC2” vision within a longer-term framework for converging technology and human progress that began with a previous study on “NBIC” fields: nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science (Roco and Bainbridge, 2003).  This is truly an impressive body of work, which advances a transformative collection of concepts that could impact many areas of society and science. The ideas of this study are exciting.   Tinsley Oden, University of Texas, Austin (April 2013)   The CKTS study presents inspirational ideas behind the concept of convergence and identifies ground-breaking opportunities for human progress through such convergence.   Christos Tokamanis, Nanotechnology and Converging Technologies, EU, Brussels (May 2013)  The study provides a systematic and unified, internationally benchmarked framework for convergence that is relevant to policymakers, entrepreneurs, researchers, and the general public.   Jo-Won Lee, Hanyang University, Korea (June 2013)  I consider .. the first NBIC study in 2001.. as an historical landmark that has caused a new dynamic in the reflection on these new technologies within the broad scientific and governmental community.   Frank Theys, Co-producer for public broadcasters ZDF/ARTE, Germany & France (June 2013)

AB  - This book describes the challenges that critical infrastructure systems face, and presents state of the art solutions to address them. How can we design intelligent systems or intelligent agents that can make appropriate real-time decisions in the management of such large-scale, complex systems? What are the primary challenges for critical infrastructure systems? The book also provides readers with the relevant information to recognize how important infrastructures are, and their role in connection with a society’s economy, security and prosperity. It goes on to describe state-of-the-art solutions to address these points, including new methodologies and instrumentation tools (e.g. embedded software and intelligent algorithms) for transforming and optimizing target infrastructures. The book is the most comprehensive resource to date for professionals in both the private and public sectors, while also offering an essential guide for students and researchers in the areas of modeling and analysis of critical infrastructure systems, monitoring, control, risk/impact evaluation, fault diagnosis, fault-tolerant control, and infrastructure dependencies/interdependencies. The importance of the research presented in the book is reflected in the fact that currently, for the first time in human history, more people live in cities than in rural areas, and that, by 2050, roughly 70% of the world’s total population is expected to live in cities.

AB  - Building upon a long tradition of scientifi c conferences dealing with problems of reliability in technical systems, in 2006 Department of Computer Engineering at Wrocław University of Technology established DepCoS-RELCOMEX series of events in order to promote a comprehensive approach to evaluation of system performability which is now commonly called dependability. Contemporary complex systems integrate variety of technical, information, soft ware and human (users, administrators and management) resources. Their complexity comes not only from involved technical and organizational structures but mainly from complexity of information processes that must be implemented in specific operational environment (data processing, monitoring, management, etc.). In such a case traditional methods of reliability evaluation focused mainly on technical levels are insufficient and more innovative, multidisciplinary methods of dependability analysis must be applied. Selection of submissions for these proceedings exemplify diversity of topics that must be included in such analyses: tools, methodologies and standards for modelling, design and simulation of the systems, security and confidentiality in information processing, specific issues of heterogeneous, today often wireless, computer networks, or management of transportation networks. In addition, this edition of the conference hosted the 5th CrISS-DESSERT Workshop devoted to the problems of security and safety in critical information systems.
