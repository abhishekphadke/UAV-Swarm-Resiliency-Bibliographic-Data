AB  - Due to the unpredictability of natural disasters, whenever a catastrophe happens, it is vital that not only emergency rescue teams are prepared, but also that there is a functional communication network infrastructure. Hence, in order to prevent additional losses of human lives, it is crucial that network operators are able to deploy an emergency infrastructure as fast as possible. In this sense, the deployment of an intelligent, mobile, and adaptable network, through the usage of drones-unmanned aerial vehicles-is being considered as one possible alternative for emergency situations. In this paper, an intelligent solution based on reinforcement learning is proposed in order to find the best position of multiple drone small cells (DSCs) in an emergency scenario. The proposed solution's main goal is to maximize the amount of users covered by the system, while drones are limited by both backhaul and radio access network constraints. Results show that the proposed <i>Q</i>-learning solution largely outperforms all other approaches with respect to all metrics considered. Hence, intelligent DSCs are considered a good alternative in order to enable the rapid and efficient deployment of an emergency communication network.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are growingly used in different aspects of our lives. As the cost of UAVs is decreasing with novel technologies, their popularity is increasing rapidly in surveillance, disaster management, agriculture, military operations, etc. The recent trend of collaborative operations of a network of UAVs to achieve a common objective has attracted the researchers as well as commercial vendors. It has revolutionized the means of data collection to maximize mission performances. However, the collaborative UAVs, with respect to the mission objective, need to be resilient to the unavailability of one or more UAVs that can be caused due to cyberattacks or technical failures. As UAVs can easily be targeted by adversaries, these devices need to maintain safe communication with each other while avoiding fuel outage and mid-air collisions, thus reducing the possibilities of being hacked but remain undetected. In this work, we present a formal framework that takes different UAV parameters in a UAV network, resiliency requirements, and resource constraints as the input, and verifies for the resiliency threats. Each threat specifies if $k$ or less number of UAVs fail, whether the rest of the network still can maintain successful communication. We illustrate the execution of this framework with an example case study. We evaluate the proposed framework to demonstrate the relationships between different parameters of a network and its resiliency. We also evaluate the framework in terms of the resiliency analysis performance and scalability.

AB  - Resilience is a much‐needed characteristic in systems that are expected to operate in uncertain environments for extended periods with a high likelihood of disruptive events. Resilience approaches today employ ad hoc methods and piece‐meal solutions that are difficult to verify and test, and do not scale. Furthermore, it is difficult to assess the long‐term impact of such ad hoc “resilience solutions.” This paper presents a flexible contract‐based approach that employs a combination of formal methods for verification and testing and flexible assertions and probabilistic modelling to handle uncertainty during mission execution. A flexible contract (FC) is a hybrid modelling construct that facilitates system verification and testing while offering the requisite flexibility to cope with non‐determinism. This paper illustrates the use of FCs for multi‐UAV swarm control in, partially observable, dynamic environments. However, the approach is sufficiently general for use in other domains such as self‐driving vehicle and adaptive power/energy grids.

AB  - Resilience approaches today rely on ad hoc methods that offer piecemeal solutions. Models used by these methods are difficult to verify and do not scale. Furthermore, it is difficult to assess their long-term impact. This chapter presents a resilient systems design approach based on formal methods that is intended to overcome these limitations. The approach combines deterministic and probabilistic modeling to create a new modeling construct that lends itself to designing scalable, resilient systems and system-of-systems (SoS). The formalism facilitates model verification and possesses requisite flexibility to handle nondeterminism. The target application domain is multi-UAV swarm control in uncertain, potentially hazardous, dynamic environments. However, the approach is sufficiently general for a variety of SoS including autonomous vehicle SoS networks.

AB  - The deployment of multiple small cells with low-power and low-cost Base Stations (BSs) offers new opportunities for increased traffic demands in Ultra Dense Networks (UDN). However, an instant increase in traffic flows, and subsequent problems with communications caused by the huge demand of users, cannot be met by the existing infrastructure since the users consume all of the network resources in unexpected turn of events (e.g. in the aftermath of large disasters). Hence, this paper aims to design a resilient UDN in order to provide an acceptable Quality of Service (QoS) in the face of unusual traffic challenge. First, by considering this extreme communication environment, we propose a queuing-based approach to model BSs and then define a resilience parameter to guarantee desired QoS. Second, we investigate the deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to serve as flying BSs. Here, we determine the required number of UAVs and optimal locations for delivering coverage. Our numerical results show that the proposed model has increased the resiliency by 27%, thus constituting a more resilient UDN.

AB  - In this work, we examine the resiliency of a state-of-the-art end-to-end video summarization (VS) application that serves as a representative emerging workload in the domain of real time edge computing. The VS application constitutes key video and image analytic elements that are processed by embedded systems aboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Real-time performance and energy constraints motivate the consideration of approximations to the VS algorithm. However, mission-critical UAV applications also demand stringent levels of resilience to soft errors that are exacerbated with higher altitude. In this work, we study the effects of three different types of software approximations on the application level resiliency (to soft errors) of the VS algorithm. We show that our approximations yield significant energy savings (up to 68%), with commensurate improvement in performance, without a degradation in the application resilience. Further, by proposing a novel quality metric (appropriate for the UAV vision analytics domain) for the summarized video output, we show that even though the rate of Silent Data Corruptions (SDCs) increases slightly (<2 %), the impact of these SDCs on output quality is limited. Thus, we conclude that software approximation can be utilized to achieve significant gains in performance and energy without affecting application resiliency.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), referenced as drones, have advanced to consumer adoption for hobby and business use. Due to this increased availability in drone technology other sectors of the economy such as infrastructure technology, security mechanisms, and resource deliveries have begun to implement drones in their own operations. Following the consumer and private sectors demand for better iterations of the product, increasingly more complex tasks will become possible due to the advances in hardware. These tasks increase the potential impacts that drones will have on applications such as smart cities, modern cities which have fully adopted technology in order to enhance daily operations as well as the welfare of its citizens. These cities are being designed to consist of mostly static mesh networks of sensors, but can contain dynamic aspects as well, including both ground and air-based autonomous vehicles. When devising networked computation devices for use in a smart city, safety should be of paramount concern. In an attempt to meet these high standards of security, services and devices should be implemented with security protocols in mind during every stage of development. Given the large number of sensors, autonomous vehicles, and other advancements, a smart city necessitates this level of security. The SHARKS protocol (Secure, Heterogeneous, Autonomous, and Rotational Knowledge for Swarms) ensures this kind of security by allowing for new applications for UAV swarm technology. Enabling drones to circle a target without centralized control or selecting lead agents, the SHARKS protocol performs organized movement among agents without creating a central point of vulnerability. Through comparisons on the stability of the protocol in different settings, experiments demonstrate the efficiency and capacity of the SHARKS protocol as a potential solution for future smart cities.

AB  - Autonomy and autonomous systems are occupying central stage in the research community, as autonomous vehicles are proliferating and their utility in all aspects of the military and civilian domains are increasing exponentially from one year to the next. The development and application of resiliency and safety technologies to autonomous systems is, unfortunately, not keeping pace with their growth rate. Several factors impede the deployment and adoption of autonomous systems. Among them is the absence of an adequately high level of autonomy that can be relied upon, significant challenges in the area of human-machine interface requiring significant human intervention to operate and interpret sensor data, the need for emerging machine learning technologies and, most importantly, the resilient design and operation of complex systems to assure their safety, reliability and availability when executing missions in unstructured and cluttered environments. Recent advances in resiliency and safety of complex engineered systems have focused on methods/tools to tradeoff system performance for increased time to failure aiming at mission completion or trial and error methods to arrive at a suboptimal policy for system self-organization in the presence of a failure mode. This paper introduces a novel framework for the resilient design and operation of such complex systems via self-organization and control reconfiguration strategies that avoid empirical trial and error techniques and may be implemented and perform in real time on-platform. The main theme is summarized as: “a healthy and resilient system is a safe system”. To accomplish this objective, we introduce an integrated and rigorous approach to resilient design while safety considerations ascertain that the targeted system is contained within a safe envelope. A resilient system is robustly and flexibly monitoring its internal and external environment, it can detect and anticipate disturbances that may affect its operational integrity and take appropriate action to compensate for the disturbance. Resilience enhances safety while improving risk factors and assures that vehicles subjected to extreme disturbances remain within their safe envelope. The enabling technologies begin with graph spectral and epidemic spreading modeling tools to represent the system behaviors under normal and faulty conditions; a Markov Decision Process is the basic self-organization module. We are introducing a novel approach to fault-tolerance by considering the impacts of severe fault modes on system performance as inputs to a Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy that trades off system performance with control activity in order to extend the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the unmanned system. Performance metrics are defined and assist in the algorithmic developments and their validation. We pursue an integrated and verifiable methodology to safety assurance that enables the evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management strategies. Several unmanned autonomous systems are used for demonstration purposes.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm applications, algorithms, and control strategies have experienced steady growth and development over the past 15 years. Yet, to date, most swarm development efforts have gone untested and unimplemented. The major inhibitors to successful swarm implementation seem to include the cost of aircraft systems, government imposed airspace restrictions, and the lack of adequate modeling and simulation tools. This paper examines how the open-source OpenEaagles simulation framework was leveraged to bridge this gap to create Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. Leveraging OpenEaagles through software extension to create HIL simulations provides developers with a functional capability with which to develop and test the behaviors of scalable and modular swarms of autonomous UAVs. Using HIL-based simulations in this capacity provides assurance that defined behaviors will propagate to live flight tests in the real world. The demonstrations in the work show how the framework enhances and simplifies swarm development through encapsulation, possesses high modularity, provides realistic aircraft modeling, and is capable of simultaneously accommodating multiple hardware-piloted and purely simulated swarming UAVs during simulation.

AB  - Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is working on an ongoing project, Resilient Autonomous Systems (RAS), supported by the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL). The objective of this project is to develop autonomous vehicle command and control (C2) technologies that demonstrate increased resilience in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) environments. Current automated solutions that offer little autonomous re-planning capability can be inflexible in handling dynamic scenarios in these environments. In this case, increased resiliency is defined as the ability of the system to better operate at or above an acceptable level of performance even in unfavorable environments, such as when encountering intelligent adversaries using Electronic Warfare (EW) and Integrated Air Defenses (IAD). The ERAU team has outlined a number of scenarios that set two teams, red and blue, against each other in a shared simulated environment. In general, the objectives for each team are as follows: The blue team assets must navigate through hostile enemy environments, collecting intelligence and reporting back to base, while minimizing the losses. The red team assets must minimize the loss of intelligence to the blue team while maximizing blue team expenditure in fuel and assets. Scenarios range from an area of 25 km2 with 10 agents on each team, to 4000 km2 and >300 agents on each team.

AB  - Multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have grown in popularity for research and education, overcoming challenges associated with fixed wing and ground robots. Unfortunately, extensive physical testing can be expensive and time consuming because of short flight times due to battery constraints and safety precautions. Simulation tools offer a low barrier to entry and enable testing and validation before field trials. However, most of the well-known simulators today have a high barrier to entry due to the need for powerful computers and the time required for initial set up. In this paper, we present OpenUAV, an open source test bed for UAV education and research that overcomes these barriers. We leverage the Containers as a Service (CaaS) technology to enable students and researchers carry out simulations on the cloud. We have based our framework on open-source tools including ROS, Gazebo, Docker, PX4, and Ansible, we designed the simulation framework so that it has no special hardware requirements. Two use-cases are presented. First, we show how a UAV can navigate around obstacles, and second, we test a multi-UAV swarm formation algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source, cloud-enabled testbed for UAVs. The code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/Open-UAV.

AB  - Cyber physical systems (CPSs) find their application in different domains, including smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0. The increasing degree of interaction among CPSs leads to unpredictable and partially unexpected behavior. The major steps to manage emerging behavior in CPSs are taken in the design process. Although a high number of methods and tools already exist from related disciplines (including complex system research, embedded system design, and self-organization), there is no comprehensive toolset available to address the extensive CPS design process. This chapter presents a proposal for a common CPS design toolset. It combines existing and emerging tools to design, simulate, evaluate, and deploy solutions for complex, real-world problems using evolutionary algorithms on the example of swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

AB  - This paper researches robust data fusion, descriptive reality and control solutions. Cognitive autonomy, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-ground communication, as well as wireless hybrid mobile mesh networks are considered. In dynamic and contested environments, the nodes and autonomous swarms must transmit and assess states, evaluate shared data, adapt to dynamic countermeasures, reconfigure, and, ensure secure communication. Robust algorithms and protocols must accomplish data management, perform vulnerability analysis, support data trustworthiness assessment, support physical-virtual reality, and evaluate functionality. Reliability of information sources and communication should be guaranteed despite adversary electronic warfare and disruptive actions. We examine science and technology of communication and data management in distributed processing, control and autonomy applications typifying adversarial environments. Our results ensure sufficient throughput, low latency, robustness, connectivity and secure communication. Topics on target recognition, object classification and dynamic tracking are researched with experimental substantiations.

AB  -  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in particular quadcopters, have become extremely prevalent, driven by their low cost and ease of control. Unfortunately, privacy concerns related to the ubiquity of UAVs have prompted substantial citizen interest in the shooting down of UAVs that trespass onto their property, although the legality thereof is unclear. In this work, the dynamical response of a quadcopter to a series of randomly external impulses, which could be generated by objects launched toward the UAV, such shotgun pellets, etc., is formulated. A Discrete Element Method (DEM) is developed to describe the breakup of the quadcopter, in conjunction with a staggered implicit time-stepping scheme. The use of DEM allows for fragmentation of the quadcopter and also to compute the trajectories and distribution of the resulting debris field.

AB  - Inspired by the emerging problem of CPS security, we introduce the concept of controller-attacker games. A controller-attacker game is a two-player stochastic game, where the two players, a controller and an attacker, have antagonistic objectives. A controller-attacker game is formulated in terms of a Markov Decision Process (MDP), with the controller and the attacker jointly determining the MDP’s transition probabilities. We also introduce the class of controller-attacker games we call V-formation games, where the goal of the controller is to maneuver the plant (a simple model of flocking dynamics) into a V-formation, and the goal of the attacker is to prevent the controller from doing so. Controllers in V-formation games utilize a new formulation of model-predictive control we have developed called Adaptive-Horizon MPC (AMPC), giving them extraordinary power: we prove that under certain controllability conditions, an AMPC controller can attain V-formation with probability 1. We evaluate AMPC’s performance on V-formation games using statistical model checking. Our experiments demonstrate that (a) as we increase the power of the attacker, the AMPC controller adapts by suitably increasing its horizon, and thus demonstrates resiliency to a variety of attacks; and (b) an intelligent attacker can significantly outperform its naive counterpart.

AB  - This paper provides an update to our ongoing Resilient Autonomous Systems (RAS) project that is being conducted at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and is supported by the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL). The objective of the RAS project is to develop a distributed multi-layer autonomous UAS planning and control technology for gathering intelligence in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) environments populated by intelligent adaptive adversaries. These resilient autonomous systems are able to navigate through hostile environments while collecting intelligence and minimizing the loss of assets. Our approach incorporates artificial life concepts, with the high-level architecture divided into three biologically inspired meta-layers: cyber-physical, reactive, and deliberative. Each meta-layer is a combination of N layers, each representing simple behavior, and collectively having a dynamic level of influence over the behavior of the agent. Algorithms within each layer act on a combination of perceptions, memory, and intents. Perceptions represent a filtered view of reality, abstracted in the layer immediately below, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next highest layer. Intents represent a recommended action output from the layer above, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next lowest layer. Each cycle, perceptions and intents are cleared. Memory permeates each layer, and allows the layers to retain some knowledge from previous cycles. Fast-reactive control systems in low meta-layers ensure a stable environment supporting cognitive function on higher meta-layers. The key concepts of our approach are: A layered architecture of intelligence on a spectrum from reactive to deliberative; the use of artificial life algorithms providing robust, complex behavior from a set of simple rules; communication of information between agents via observation; the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to assist the team in selecting and adapting the best solutions for each layer. This distributed cooperative system of intelligent assets will provide adaptable, scalable performance to accomplish mission goals in challenging environments.

AB  -  Network deployment in wireless networks implies the distribution of the communication nodes to improve some key operational aspects, such as energy saving, coverage, connectivity, or simply reducing the network cost. Most node placement approaches are focused on static scenarios like WSNs, where the topology of the network does not vary over time. Nevertheless, there exist certain situations in which the network node locations can continuously change. In this case, the use of special nodes, so-called Relay Nodes (RNs), contributes to supporting, maintaining or recovering communication in the network. The present work introduces a multi-stage dynamical RN placement solution to lead the RNs to their time-varying optimized positions. The approach, named Dynamical Relay Node placement Solution (DRNS), is based on the use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms and is inspired by Model Predictive Control (MPC) techniques following a bi-objective optimization procedure, where both network connectivity and throughput are jointly maximized. DRNS is validated in both simulated and real environments composed of mobile robotic nodes, the results showing its goodness and operational suitability for real MANET environments.

AB  - This paper presents a two-phase mathematical framework for efficient power network damage assessment using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In the first phase, a two-stage stochastic integer programming optimization model is presented for damage assessment in which the first stage determines the optimal UAV locations anticipating an arrival of an extreme weather event, and the second stage is to adjust the UAV locations, if necessary, when the arrival time of the predicted extreme weather becomes closer with updated information. UAV paths to scan the power network are generated in the second phase to minimize operating costs and final damage assessment completion time of the UAVs. Computational techniques are developed to help reduce the solution time. Numerical experiments show that the proposed stochastic model outperforms the deterministic counterpart in terms of the total UAV pre-positioning setup cost. Additionally, sensitivity analysis discovered the relations among damage assessment time, UAV pre-positioning setup cost, and operating cost.

AB  - The energy sector represents undoubtedly one of the most significant “test cases” for 5G enabling technologies, due to the need of addressing a huge range of very diverse requirements to deal with across a variety of applications (stringent capacity for smart metering/AMI versus latency for supervisory control and fault localization). However, to effectively support energy utilities along their transition towards more decentralized renewable-oriented systems, several open issues still remain as to 5G networks management automation, security, resilience, scalability and portability. To face these issues, we outline a novel 5G PPP-compliant software framework specifically tailored to the energy domain, which combines i) trusted, scalable and lock-in free plug ‘n’ play support for a variety of constrained devices; ii) 5G devices’ abstractions to demonstrate mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications), uMTC (critical MTC) and xMBB (Extended Massive BroadBand) communications coupled with partially distributed, trusted, end-to-end security and MCM to enable secure, scalable and energy efficient communications; iii) extended Mobile Edge Computing (xMEC) micro-clouds to reduce backhaul load, increase the overall network capacity and reduce delays, while facilitating the deployment of generic MTC related NFVs (Network Function Virtualisation) and utility-centric VNFs (Virtual Network Functions).

AB  - To protect multicores from soft-error perturbations, research has explored various resiliency schemes that provide high soft-error coverage. However, these schemes incur high performance and energy overheads. We observe that not all soft-error perturbations affect program correctness, and some soft-errors only affect program accuracy, i.e., the program completes with certain acceptable deviations from error free outcome. Thus, it is practical to improve processor efficiency by trading off resiliency overheads with program accuracy. This article proposes the idea of declarative resilience that selectively applies strong resiliency schemes for code regions that are crucial for program correctness (crucial code) and lightweight resiliency for code regions that are susceptible to program accuracy deviations as a result of soft-errors (non-crucial code). At the application level, crucial and non-crucial code is identified based on its impact on the program outcome. A cross-layer architecture enables efficient resilience along with holistic soft-error coverage. Only program accuracy is compromised in the worst-case scenario of a soft-error strike during non-crucial code execution. For a set of machine-learning and graph analytic benchmarks, declarative resilience reduces performance overhead over a state-of-the-art system that applies strong resiliency for all program code regions from ∼ 1.43× to ∼ 1.2×.

AB  - Self-organizing systems (SOS) possess the potential of performing complex tasks in uncertain situations with adaptability. Despite the benefits of self-organizing, it is also subject to the influence of unpredictable behavior of individual agents and environment noises. In hostile situations for example, individual performance of self-organizing agents may deteriorate and this can lead to system malfunction, posing great challenge for the design of SOS. In this paper, we propose a trust based model as a design approach to SOS in consideration of the capability heterogeneity of the agents. A box-pushing task was presented and studied. Trust is measured using beta probability distribution, which takes into account both the positive and negative interactions between the agents. The simulation results have shown that our trust model ensures favorable interactions among agents and leads to increased system effectiveness and conditional system efficiency improvement in comparison to SOS without using a trust model.Copyright © 2018 by ASME

AB  - Multi-model techniques have shown an outstanding effectiveness in the cooperative task assignment and path planning of the unmanned combat aerial vehicle(UCAV) formation. With cooperative decision making and control, the cooperative combat of the UCAV formation are described and the mathematical model of the UCAV formation is built. Then, the task assignment model of the UCAV formation is developed according to flight characteristics of the UCAV formation and constraints in battlefield. The cooperative task assignment problem is solved using the improved particle swarm optimization(IPSO), ant colony algorithm(ACA) and genetic algorithm(GA) respectively. The comparative analysis is conducted in the aspects of the precision and the search speed. The path planning model of the UCAV formation is constructed considering the oil cost, threat cost, crash cost and time cost. The cooperative path planning problem is solved based on the evolution algorithm(EA), in which unique coding scheme of chromosomes is designed, and the crossover operator and mutation operator are redefined. Simulation results demonstrate that the UCAV formation can choose the best algorithm according to the real battlefield environment, which can solve the cooperative task assignment and path planning problems quickly and effectively to meet the demand of the cooperative combat.

AB  - As a result of the rapid technological advances on electronic, sensors and communication technologies, and increasingly popular multi-sized unmanned aerial vehicles, also referred to as drones, flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) are rapidly proliferating and leading the emergence of Internet of Drones and its applications. Because of the versatility, flexibility, easy installation, and relatively small operating expenses of drones, FANETs have enormous potential in the public and civil domains. However, due to unique characteristics of FANETs, routing demands of FANETs go beyond the needs of mobile ad hoc networks and vehicular ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose a jamming-resilient multipath routing protocol, also called JarmRout, so that intentional jamming and disruption or isolated and localized failures do not interrupt the overall network performance of FANETs. To achieve this goal, the JarmRout relies on a combination of three major schemes that are link quality scheme, traffic load scheme, and spatial distance scheme. We present a simple analytical model and its numerical result in terms of RREP packet reception rate of source node. We also evaluate the proposed routing protocol through extensive simulation experiments using the OMNeT++ and compare its performance with three representative routing protocols that are dynamic source routing, optimized link state routing, and split multipath routing. Simulation results show that the JarmRout can not only improve packet delivery ratio and packet delivery latency but also can reduce end-to-end communication outage rate without introducing extra communication overhead, indicating a viable approach to improve network resiliency in the presence of malicious jammers in FANETs.

AB  - Remote attestation protocols are widely used to detect device configuration (e.g., software and/or data) compromise in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Unfortunately, the performances of such protocols are unsatisfactory when dealing with thousands of smart devices. Recently, researchers are focusing on addressing this limitation. The approach is to run attestation in a collective way, with the goal of reducing computation and communication. Despite these advances, current solutions for attestation are still unsatisfactory because of their complex management and strict assumptions concerning the topology (e.g., being time invariant or maintaining a fixed topology). In this paper, we propose PADS, a secure, efficient, and practical protocol for attesting potentially large networks of smart devices with unstructured or dynamic topologies. PADS builds upon the recent concept of non-interactive attestation, by reducing the collective attestation problem into a minimum consensus one. We compare PADS with a state-of-the art collective attestation protocol and validate it by using realistic simulations that show practicality and efficiency. The results confirm the suitability of PADS for low-end devices, and highly unstructured networks.

Therefore, this paper presents a step towards the design of robust non-fragile BPC for wind energy conversion system. The proposed approach presents all boundaries of stability region that can guarantee robust stability (RS) over a wide range of operating conditions. The proposed technique results from the complementarity of both Root-Locus and Routh-Hurwitz (RL/RH) approach. Continuous variation in the operating conditions is tackled through a new hybrid control technique based on the referential integrity of both RL/RH and Kharitonov (Kh) theorem. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed designing approach in computing the most resilient and robust controller.

Monitoring the atmosphere with DDDAS principles has evolved into domain methods for space awareness, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) design, and biomedical applications. Recent efforts reflect the digital age of information management architecture design such as multimedia analysis, power grid control, and biohealth concerns. Underlying a majority of DDDAS developments are advances in sensor design, information filtering, and computational systems.

AB  - A technical overview of self-organization for enabling efficient machine-to-machine (M2M) communication networks for the Internet of things (IoT) is presented. M2M networks consists of intelligent machines often including sensors, actuators, and computing nodes that enable automated sensing, data gathering and processing, and information exchange. Self-organization mechanisms are needed to minimize human intervention and enable distributed intelligence with local information exchange. Thus, self-organizing M2M networks act as building blocks for the IoT. In this chapter, the aim is to give an overview of IoT and important M2M communication network use-cases which motivate the application of self-organized networking approaches and to highlight related challenges and opportunities. We give an introduction to self-organizing systems and discuss self-organization approaches in contemporary cellular networks and its potential for future networks especially M2M communication networks for IoT. Considering the diverse requirements of M2M use-cases in terms of scalability, latency, cost, overhead, and reliability, the focus is on a fundamental question: How can M2M networks in IoT benefit from self-organized networking paradigms? To this end, we discuss M2M networks that involve heterogeneous devices communicating directly to other devices in proximity, without centralized control by network infrastructure. The use-cases discussed here include home networking, vehicle-to-vehicle/roadside networks, and public safety networks. In home M2M networking scenarios based on low-power short-range communication technologies, self-organizing mechanisms can enable autonomous and seamless connectivity between heterogeneous devices. In contrast, vehicular networks such as vehicle-to-vehicle require self-organization due to mission-critical aspects such as stringent latency requirements and changing topology. Likewise, public safety networks are also mission-critical and require not only rapid deployment and resiliency but also self-healing capabilities that are the cornerstone of self-organizing networks. We conclude that self-organization is an effective paradigm for rapid, resource-efficient, and low-cost deployments of heterogeneous M2M networks, which makes it an important enabler for IoT.

AB  - Multicores increasingly deploy spatial execution of safety-critical applications that demand a deterministic, resilient, and secure environment to meet the safety standards. However, multicores aggressively share hardware resources that leads to non-deterministic performance due to destructive interference from concurrent applications. Resource sharing not only hinders efficient resilient execution, but also introduces security vulnerabilities due to information leakage on side-channels. This work proposes a novel multicore framework that constructs isolated clusters of cores for each concurrent application. It guarantees concurrent applications with deterministic performance, as well as an efficient execution environment for resiliency and security. Moreover, the framework allows dynamic re-sizing of cluster sizes for load balanced execution of concurrent applications. However, it leads to diminished isolation between clusters, which opens various performanceresilience and performancesecurity tradeoffs.

AB  - Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, a substantial body of research has focused on the development of computational tools and analytical frameworks for modeling oil spill events. Much of this work is dedicated to deepening our understanding of the interactions between oil, fragile ecosystems, and the environment, as well as the impacts of oil on human settlements which are vulnerable to spill events. These advances in oil spill modeling and associated analytics have not only increased the efficiency of spill interdiction and mitigation efforts, they have also helped to nurture proactive, versus reactive, response strategies and plans for local and regional stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a progress report on the wide range of computational tools, analytical frameworks, and emerging technologies which are necessary inputs for a complete oil spill modeling package. Specifically, we explore the use of relatively mature tools, such as dedicated spill modeling packages, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing, as well emerging technologies such as aerial and aquatic drones and other in-situ sensing technologies. The integration of these technologies and the advantages associated with using a geographic lens for oil spill modeling are discussed.

AB  - Abstract. We introduce a new mobile, simultaneous terrestrial and aerial, geodata collection and post-processing method: mapKITE. By combining two mapping technologies such as terrestrial mobile mapping and unmanned aircraft aerial mapping, geodata are simultaneously acquired from air and ground. More in detail, a mapKITE geodata acquisition system consists on an unmanned aircraft and a terrestrial vehicle, which hosts the ground control station. By means of a real-time navigation system on the terrestrial vehicle, real-time waypoints are sent to the aircraft from the ground. By doing so, the aircraft is linked to the terrestrial vehicle through a “virtual tether,” acting as a “mapping kite.” In the article, we entail the concept of mapKITE as well as the various technologies and techniques involved, from aircraft guidance and navigation based on IMU and GNSS, optical cameras for mapping and tracking, sensor orientation and calibration, etc. Moreover, we report of a new measurement introduced in mapKITE, that is, point-and-scale photogrammetric measurements [of image coordinates and scale] for optical targets of known size installed on the ground vehicle roof. By means of accurate posteriori trajectory determination of the terrestrial vehicle, mapKITE benefits then from kinematic ground control points which are photogrametrically observed by point-and-scale measures. Initial results for simulated configurations show that these measurements added to the usual Integrated Sensor Orientation ones reduce or even eliminate the need of conventional ground control points –therefore, lowering mission costs– and enable selfcalibration of the unmanned aircraft interior orientation parameters in corridor configurations, in contrast to the situation of traditional corridor configurations. Finally, we report about current developments of the first mapKITE prototype, developed under the European Union Research and Innovation programme Horizon 2020. The first mapKITE mission will be held at the BCN Drone Center (Collsuspina, Moià, Spain) in mid 2016.

AB  - Transient stabilization of the power system network is of major importance in this era of the deregulated power systems. Static VAR compensator (SVC) proves to be more economical and efficient than its other counterparts. Due to installation cost of SVCs, there is an exigent requirement to optimize the SVC installation that could yield maximum benefit. In this paper, first the contingencies that result in maximum disturbance to the grid are realized and ranked accordingly. The measurement used for this purpose is the voltage profile index. Next, genetic algorithm has been used to find out the rating of the SVC and its location that could mitigate the contingency and minimize the weighted sum of the total power loss in the grid, sum of voltage deviations at all the buses, and the rating of SVC to be installed. The weights of each of the objective function terms are assigned according to their importance for the system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied to two test networks. It has been found out that the obtained SVC location and rating maintained voltage security and minimized power loss in the event of contingency.

AB  - The United States seeks conventional military overmatch in the strategic competition with China and Russia through efforts to develop advanced technology for military application and new concept of operations as well as pursue organizational adaptation and human talent pool development. The current article will trace the development of US defense innovation efforts from the Obama administration to the Trump administration and focus on the technological dimension of defense innovation by illustrating ways through which the U.S. Department of Defense is attempting to apply “narrow” artificial intelligence for military purposes such as situational awareness, cyber, military logistics, command and control, and swarm technology and tactics for autonomous unmanned systems. The article will conclude by making two caveats regarding the actual introduction of artificial intelligence into the US battle network, and very briefly point to implications for US allies.

AB  - The prospect of using unmanned systems in dull, dirty, or dangerous jobs to save work or even lives has drawn increasing attention in the DoD. Unmanned ground vehicles are used in theatre to get views into buildings or to destroy suspected IEDs. Unmanned air vehicles are used to get views over the next hill or to deliver munitions on targets thousands of miles away. While the automation and sensing capabilities have increased, interaction with these systems is still fairly rudimentary. Deployed systems typically use tele-operation or waypoint control, in some cases requiring operators to carry heavy operator control units. These approaches place a high burden on the operator in terms of the added weight and the constant attention required to operate the systems. In fact, many of these systems require more than a single operator to control a single platform, which increases the cost and logistics of using them. This paper describes natural, multi-modal interfaces as an alternative to the current state of the practice in controlling unmanned systems, with the goal of leveraging how people already communicate with each other in order to reduce the physical and cognitive burdens of interacting with unmanned systems. We describe approaches and challenges in designing, building, and evaluating natural interfaces. We present our Smart Interaction Device (SID) as an example natural interface for interaction with unmanned systems, and highlight some use cases we have applied it to in the air and ground domains.

AB  - This book explores the ways that disciplinary convergence and technological advance are transforming systems engineering to address gaps in complex systems engineering: Transdisciplinary Systems Engineering (TSE). TSE reaches beyond traditional disciplines to find connections—and this book examines a range of new methods from across such disparate areas of scholarship as computer science, social science, human studies, and systems design to reveal patterns, efficiencies, affordances, and pathways to intuitive design. Organized to serve multiple constituencies, the book stands as an ideal textbook supplement for graduate courses in systems engineering, a reference text for program managers and practicing engineers in all industries, and a primary source for researchers engaged in multidisciplinary research in systems engineering and design. Introduces a bold, new vision of where model-based systems architecting and engineering is headed; Maximizes reader understanding of recent advances in social networks, collaboration technologies, interactive storytelling, virtual worlds, and systems design that enable transdisciplinary systems engineering; Illustrates convergence among disciplines across social, human, and applied sciences with robust examples;  Facilitates creation of new courses in systems architecting and engineering by structuring each chapter as an independent resource, allowing the content to be presented in order of academic need. Azad Madni has eloquently and substantively addressed one of the most important issues facing 21st Century systems engineering and design. The author makes it clear that an environment of autonomous systems, system of systems, and the internet of things will require that we are able to apply more than math and science to solve thorny problems. They will necessitate that systems engineers and designers have an understanding of the intricate interactions that can exist between technology and humans.

AB  - Relay node placement in wireless environments is a research topic recurrently studied in the specialized literature. A variety of network performance goals, such as coverage, data rate and network lifetime, are considered as criteria to lead the placement of the nodes. In this work, a new relay placement approach to maximize network connectivity in a multi-hop wireless network is presented. Here, connectivity is defined as a combination of inter-node reachability and network throughput. The nodes are placed following a two-step procedure: (i) initial distribution, and (ii) solution selection. Additionally, a third stage for placement optimization is optionally proposed to maximize throughput. This tries to be a general approach for placement, and several initialization, selection and optimization algorithms can be used in each of the steps. For experimentation purposes, a leave-one-out selection procedure and a PSO related optimization algorithm are employed and evaluated for second and third stages, respectively. Other node placement solutions available in the literature are compared with the proposed one in realistic simulated scenarios. The results obtained through the properly devised experiments show the improvements achieved by the proposed approach.

AB  - Rapid advances in automation are allowing technology to replace tasks once performed by humans. Prototypes of autonomous military vehicles reveal a future system-of-systems with significant potential to positively enhance military operations. However, such a complex system of multiple autonomous vehicles will surely face perilous situations that, if the system is architected incorrectly, could doom the system. Resilience techniques exist to enable a system to face disruptions and continue operating within a specified manner; this paper explores techniques and ideas for applying resilience to such a system.

AB  - Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an evolving network architecture paradigm that focuses on the separation of control and data planes. SDN receives increasing attention both from academia and industry, across a multitude of application domains. In this article, we examine the current state of obtained knowledge on military SDN by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR). Through this work, we seek to evaluate the current state of the art in terms of research tracks, publications, methods, trends, and most active research areas. Accordingly, we utilize these findings for consolidating the areas of past and current research on the examined application domain, and propose directions for future research.

AB  - This volume investigates a number of issues needed to develop a modular, effective, versatile, cost effective, pedagogically-embedded, user-friendly, and sustainable online laboratory system that can deliver its true potential in the national and global arenas. This allows individual researchers to develop their own modular systems with a level of creativity and innovation while at the same time ensuring continuing growth by separating the responsibility for creating online laboratories from the responsibility for overseeing the students who use them. The volume first introduces the reader to several system architectures that have proven successful in many online laboratory settings. The following chapters then describe real-life experiences in the area of online laboratories from both technological and educational points of view. The volume further collects experiences and evidence on the effective use of online labs in the context of a diversity of pedagogical issues. It also illustrates successful online laboratories to highlight best practices as case studies and describes the technological design strategies, implementation details, and classroom activities as well as learning from these developments. Finally the volume describes the creation and deployment of commercial products, tools and services for online laboratory development. It also provides an idea about the developments that are on the horizon to support this area.

AB  - For improved corporate governance in this age of digitalization, the Board of Directors could investigate key operating performance indicators or KPIs for competitive advantages with Digitalization Dashboards. There are over 30 such digital metrics in the Digitalization Dashboard example in this paper. A starting point for developing such key metrics could be the digital values indicated by the “efficient stock market” with the market to book ratio calculation. The ten “new economy” companies had an average market to book ratio of 10.85 while the ten “old economy” companies had an average market to book ratio of 2.64. Why are sophisticated investors indicating that the equity market value or market capitalization of “new economy” companies is almost eleven times larger on average than their equity book value? Why is the average market to book ratio of “new economy” companies over four times larger than for “old economy” companies? What key digitalization metrics and competitive advantages are in play here? Digital dashboards are recommended here to answer such questions. While the awareness on boards regarding risks originating from disruptive innovation, cyber threats and privacy risks has been increasing, board members must equally be able to challenge executives and identify opportunities and threats for their companies. This shift for companies is not only about digital technology but also cultural. How can people be managed when digital, virtual ways of working are increasing? What do robotics and “big data” analysis mean for managing people? One way to accelerate the digital learning process has been advocated: the use of digital apprentices for boards. For example, Board Apprentice, a non-profit organization, has already placed digital apprentices on boards for a year-long period (which helps to educate both apprentices and boards) in five different countries.

AB  - The expansion of human capability through emerging technologies resulting from converging developments in advanced robotics, information technology, and the cognitive sciences has served as a point of fascination for literature and the box office alike, but it also is transforming the landscape of contemporary medicine, science, and technology. Developments in robotics over the past few decades in manufacturing, shipping, and military applications have already begun to profoundly reshape these industries. Similarly, the healthcare, service industries, and the transportation sector are poised to join this robotic revolution through the increasing sophistication of surgical robots and other robotic caregivers. Given the vast potential of this form of emerging technologies, this entry explores the field of robotic technology across a wide range of industries and the subsequent discourse of robot ethics to consider if there are inherent concerns or dangers in the utilization of these emerging technologies. Additional attention is given to ethical considerations and social implications of these technologies, as well as to legal and other policy questions raised with respect to regulating robotics for the public good.

AB  - At the request of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT and L)), the Defense Science Board (DSB) conducted a study on the applicability of autonomy to Department of Defense (DoD) missions. The study concluded that there are both substantial operational benefits and potential perils associated with the use of autonomy. Autonomy delivers significant military value, including opportunities to reduce the number of warfighters in harms way, increase the quality and speed of decisions in time-critical operations, and enable new missions that would otherwise be impossible. Autonomy is by no means new to the DoD. Fielded capabilities demonstrate ongoing progress in embedding autonomous functionality into systems, and many development programs already underway include an increasingly sophisticated use of autonomy. Autonomy also delivers significant value across a diverse array of global markets. Both enabling technologies and commercial applications are advancing rapidly in response to market opportunities. Autonomy is becoming a ubiquitous enabling capability for products spanning a spectrum from expert advisory systems to autonomous vehicles. Commercial market forces are accelerating progress, providing opportunities for DoD to leverage the investments of others, while also providing substantial capabilities to potential adversaries. This study concluded that DoD must accelerate its exploitation of autonomy both to realize the potential military value and to remain ahead of adversaries who also will exploit its operational benefits.

AB  - The aim of this book is to provide the latest research findings, innovative research results, methods and development techniques from both theoretical and practical perspectives related to intelligent social networks and collaborative systems, intelligent networking systems, mobile collaborative systems, secure intelligent cloud systems, etc., and to reveal synergies among various paradigms in the multi-disciplinary field of intelligent collaborative systems. It presents the Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCoS-2017), held on August 24–26, 2017 in Toronto, Canada. With the rapid evolution of the Internet, we are currently experiencing a shift from the traditional sharing of information and applications as the main purpose of the Web to an emergent paradigm that puts people at the very centre of networks and exploits the value of people’s connections, relations and collaborations. Social networks are also pla ying a major role in the dynamics and structure of intelligent Web-based networking and collaborative systems. Virtual campuses, virtual communities and organizations effectively leverage intelligent networking and collaborative systems by tapping into a broad range of formal and informal electronic relations, such as business-to-business, peer-to-peer and many types of online collaborative learning interactions, including the emerging e-learning systems. This has resulted in entangled systems that need to be managed efficiently and autonomously. In addition, the latest and powerful technologies based on Grid and wireless infrastructure as well as Cloud computing are now greatly enhancing collaborative and networking applications, but are also facing new issues and challenges. The principal objective of the research and development community is to stimulate research that leads to the creation of responsive environments for networking and, in the longer-term, the developmen t of adaptive, secure, mobile, and intuitive intelligent systems for collaborative work and learning.

AB  - Integrating the various embedded devices and systems in our environment enables an Internet of Things (IoT) for a smart city. The IoT will generate tremendous amount of data that can be leveraged for safety, efficiency, and infotainment applications and services for city residents. The management of this voluminous data through its lifecycle is fundamental to the realization of smart cities. Therefore, in contrast to existing surveys on smart cities we provide a data-centric perspective, describing the fundamental data management techniques employed to ensure consistency, interoperability, granularity, and reusability of the data generated by the underlying IoT for smart cities. Essentially, the data lifecycle in a smart city is dependent on tightly coupled data management with cross-cutting layers of data security and privacy, and supporting infrastructure. Therefore, we further identify techniques employed for data security and privacy, and discuss the networking and computing technologies that enable smart cities. We highlight the achievements in realizing various aspects of smart cities, present the lessons learned, and identify limitations and research challenges.

AB  - This paper deploys a recently proposed, biologically inspired, on-line, search-based optimization technique called Selective Evolutionary Generation Systems (SEGS) for control purposes; here, to evolve Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) flapping wing gaits in changing flight conditions to maintain hovering flight and track trajectories in unsteady airflow. The SEGS technique has several advantages, including: (1) search-efficiency, by optimally trading off prior search space information for search effort savings as quickly as possible in dynamic environments; (2) model-independence, as in biology, avoiding biases induced by built-in models rendered incorrect by environment changes; and (3) resilience, through sufficiency for stochastic behavior that is itself sufficient for responsiveness to search-objective variations caused by environment fluctuations. This work presents the first approach that can simultaneously evolve optimal MAV flapping wing gaits efficiently and resiliently, adapt on-line, and, via model-independence, allow feedback from either experimental sensors or alternate external models (affording control versatility for hover or forward flight, unsteady or quasi-steady aerodynamics, and any dynamics or wing kinematics). Performance benchmarks are also provided. Because the (1+1)-Evolution Strategy (ES) and the Canonical Genetic Algorithm with Fitness Proportional Selection (CGAFPS) are two SEGS special extreme cases, an additional comparison showcases SEGS possession of both (1+1)-ES computational speed and CGAFPS resilience.

AB  - Managing cloud applications is complex, and the current state of the art is not addressing this issue. The ever‐growing software ecosystem continues to increase the knowledge required to manage cloud applications at a time when there is already an IT skills shortage. Solving this issue requires capturing IT operation knowledge in software so that this knowledge can be reused by system administrators who do not have it. The presented research tackles this issue by introducing a new and fundamentally different way to approach cloud application management: a hierarchical collection of independent software agents, collectively managing the cloud application. Each agent encapsulates knowledge of how to manage specific parts of the cloud application, is driven by sending and receiving cloud models, and collaborates with other agents by communicating using conversations. The entirety of communication and collaboration in this collection is called the orchestrator conversation. A thorough evaluation shows the orchestrator conversation makes it possible to encapsulate IT operations knowledge that current solutions cannot, reduces the complexity of managing a cloud application, and happens inherently concurrent. The evaluation also shows that the conversation figures out how to deploy a single big data cluster in less than 100 milliseconds, which scales linearly to less than 10 seconds for 100 clusters, resulting in a minimal overhead compared with the deployment time of at least 20 minutes with the state of the art. The orchestrator conversation simplifies model‐based management of cloud applications by giving system administrators tools to create design‐ and run‐time abstractions that hide underlying operational complexity. The orchestrator conversation consists of a hierarchical collection of independent software agents driven by cloud models that collectively manage a cloud application and collaborate to resolve service dependencies. Evaluations show it reduces complexity with a minimal overhead, <100 milliseconds for a single cluster, which scales well to <10 s for 100 clusters.

AB  - Stochastic optimization techniques by definition offer an element of randomness on the search trajectory for the best solution to an objective, and can be leveraged to gain confidence over traditional deterministic approaches. A novel method, Probability Collectives (PC) of Collective Intelligence (COIN), performs this type of stochastic search directly in the probability domain rather than in the variable domain, and enables a parallel processing architecture relevant to a distributed flight control system. Cooperating agents learn a local optimal strategy to minimize a global system cost. In this paper, we define these agents as individual aircraft effectors working to zero an acceleration error for the rigid body stability and control application. We present our initial acclimation to the PC framework with two forms of the method, delayed and immediate sampling, first in a simplified example setting with a two dimensional nonlinear objective, and finally in recent work for distributed control allocation of a hypothetical air vehicle with five effectors.

AB  - As automatic optimization techniques find their way into industrial applications, the behavior of many complex systems is determined by some form of planner picking the right actions to optimize a given objective function. In many cases, the mapping of plans to objective reward may change due to unforeseen events or circumstances in the real world. In those cases, the planner usually needs some additional effort to adjust to the changed situation and reach its previous level of performance. Whenever we still need to continue polling the planner even during re-planning, it oftentimes exhibits severely lacking performance. In order to improve the planner's resilience to unforeseen change, we argue that maintaining a certain level of diversity amongst the considered plans at all times should be added to the planner's objective. Effectively, we encourage the planner to keep alternative plans to its currently best solution. As an example case, we implement a diversity-aware genetic algorithm using two different metrics for diversity (differing in their generality) and show that the blow in performance due to unexpected change can be severely lessened in the average case. We also analyze the parameter settings necessary for these techniques in order to gain an intuition how they can be incorporated into larger frameworks or process models for software and systems engineering.

AB  - The trend toward small-sized spacecraft continues in government applications and is even increasing in commercial space endeavors that are funded by venture capital. Small spacecraft, including nanosatellites, microsatellites, and small satellites (smallsats), are an attractive alternative to traditional, larger spacecraft due to reduced development costs, decreased launch costs, and increased launch opportunities. A significant disadvantage, however, of a small spacecraft is its reduced or limited capabilities. The physical size of the small spacecraft reduces the size of the payload and/or the number of payloads that it can host, its propulsion capabilities, and its power. Small spacecraft are most commonly used in low Earth orbit, limiting the number of observation opportunities for a particular area of the Earth or space and the number of ground station downlink opportunities for stored data. These constraints affect the complexity and types of applications that small spacecraft can serve. Using multiple spacecraft that work together can overcome many of these limitations and expand the utility of small spacecraft. Two concepts for cooperative groups of spacecraft are constellations and clusters. A key technical challenge for small spacecraft, constellations, and clusters is communication of data. Communication challenges exist for accommodating varying numbers of users, serving high user densities in a given geographical area, and providing a consistent quality of service for different types of applications (e.g., Internet access, voice communication, machine-to-machine). This paper explores concepts for emerging communication technologies for space-ground and inter-satellite communication, while citing examples of existing and new constellation and cluster concepts. Several aspects of the communication systems are examined in terms of frequency bands, data rates, multiple access methods, and accommodation on spacecraft.

AB  - Systemsengineering (SE) is understood as an interdisciplinary collaborative approach to derive, evolve, and verify a life cycle balanced system solution. Satisfying customer expectations has become more complicated and complex, as we are no longer designing systems optimized for a single point, but instead are focusing on systems which are sustainable, resilient, flexible, and even antifragile. Simulation is established to support analysis and testing of systems. Recent developments—the use of executable architecture concepts allowing for dynamic evaluation of system concepts, and the use of agent-based implementation to support learning and adaptive system behavior—allow better support of an agile enterprise. To support these ideas, simulation must be fully integrated into SE paradigm. We must establish simulation as an integrated discipline within the SE methodology. Research is needed to support validation and verification of self-modifying systems, as well as improved heuristics for computationally complex problems. This chapter proposes detailed visions and identifies a research agenda needed to realize these visions accordingly.

AB  - Optimal operation configuration of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can be determined by utilizing exact mathematical programming techniques such as Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). However, computational complexities of such techniques are high. As a remedy, learning algorithms such as Neural Networks (NNs) can be utilized to predict the WSN settings with high accuracy with much lower computational cost than the MIP solutions. We focus on predicting network lifetime, transmission power level, and internode distance which are interrelated WSN parameters and are vital for optimal WSN operation. To facilitate an efficient solution for predicting these parameters without explicit optimizations, we built NN based models employing data obtained from an MIP model. The NN based scalable prediction model yields a maximum of 3% error for lifetime, 6% for transmission power level error, and internode distances within an accuracy of 3 m in prediction outcomes.

AB  - Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) have drawn tremendous attention because of their potential impact on scientific research and their numerous attractive applications. Routing in WMSNs has been an active area of research in the past few years. The transmission of multimedia data depends on a routing protocol to determine stable and resource-efficient path, and to provide varying levels of Quality-of-Service (QoS)/Quality-of-Experience (QoE) guarantee for multimedia. However, it is a challenging problem due to the limited network resources and complicated operations of multimedia applications as well as dynamic changes of network condition. This paper begins with the challenges and requirements in the design of WMSN routing, followed by an exhaustive survey on routing from the perspective of application requirements and key techniques. In particular, the existing routing solutions are classified into five major categories based on their design and optimization objectives, that is, QoS provisioning, multimedia awareness, energy efficiency, congestion avoidance, bandwidth optimization. Finally, we will discuss the open research issues in routing metrics and several potential research areas regarding routing in emerging WMSN application scenarios.

AB  - The 2014 Reinventing Space conference presented a number of questions in the context of a constantly innovating space industry, from addressing the future of global cooperation, investigating the impact of cuts in US government spending on the private space sector, and probing the overall future of the commercial launch sector. Space tourism and new technology promise the revival of interest in space development (the Apollo Era was the first period of intense space activity and growth). The need to create dramatically lower cost, responsive and reliable launch systems and spacecraft has never been more vital. Advances in technology are allowing smaller and cheaper satellites to be orbited - from cubesats to nanosatellites to femtosatellites. Thanks to more efficient new launch possibilities, low cost access to space is becoming ever more achievable. Commercial companies and countries are targeting the industry with new funding. Organised by the British Interplanetary Society, the presentations at this conference thoroughly address these challenges and opportunities.

AB  - This book brings together emerging objectives and paradigms in the control of both AC and DC microgrids; further, it facilitates the integration of renewable-energy and distribution systems through localization of generation, storage and consumption. The control objectives in a microgrid are addressed through the hierarchical control structure. After providing a comprehensive survey on the state of the art in microgrid control, the book goes on to address the most recent control schemes for both AC and DC microgrids, which are based on the distributed cooperative control of multi-agent systems. The cooperative control structure discussed distributes the co-ordination and optimization tasks across all distributed generators. This does away with the need for a central controller, and the control system will not collapse in response to the outage of a single unit. This avoids adverse effects on system flexibility and configurability, as well as the reliability concerns in connection with single points of failure that arise in traditional, centralized microgrid control schemes. Rigorous proofs develop each control methodology covered in the book, and simulation examples are provided to justify all of the proposed algorithms. Given its extensive yet self-contained content, the book offers a comprehensive source of information for graduate students, academic researchers, and practicing engineers working in the field of microgrid control and optimization. Advances in Industrial Control aims to report and encourage the transfer of technology in control engineering. The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of new work in all aspects of industrial control.

AB  - These proceedings contain research presented at the 6th International Conference on Dynamics in Logistics, held in February 2018.The integration of dynamics within the modeling, planning and control of logistic processes and networks has shown to contribute massively to the improvement of the latter. Moreover, diversification of markets and demand has increased both the complexity and the dynamic changes of problems within the area of logistics. To cope with these challenges, it must become possible to identify, describe and analyze such process changes. Moreover, logistic processes and networks must be revised to be rapidly and flexibly adaptable to continuously changing conditions. This book presents new ideas to solve such problems, offering technological, algorithmic and conceptual improvements. It primarily addresses researchers and practitioners in the field of industrial engineering and logistics.

With the merge of intelligent devices, intelligent systems, and intelligent decisioning with the latest information technologies, the Industrial Internet will enhance the productivity, reduce cost and wastes through the entire industrial economy. This paper starts by investigating the brief history of the Industrial Internet. We then present the 5C architecture that is widely adopted to characterize the Industrial Internet systems. Then, we investigate the enabling technologies of each layer that cover from industrial networking, industrial intelligent sensing, cloud computing, big data, smart control, and security management. This provides the foundations for those who are interested in understanding the essence and key enablers of the Industrial Internet. Moreover, we discuss the application domains that are gradually transformed by the Industrial Internet technologies, including energy, health care, manufacturing, public section, and transportation. Finally, we present the current technological challenges in developing Industrial Internet systems to illustrate open research questions that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of future Industrial Internet systems.

AB  - Dealing with Allies in Decline: Alliance Management and U.S. Strategy in an Era of Global Power Shifts is the latest study by CSBA Senior Fellow Hal Brands. In the monograph, Brands argues that although America's alliances are a source of great geopolitical strength, the difficult reality is that shifts in global economic and military power have left many of America's traditional allies with significantly diminished relative standing and capabilities. The monograph assesses the key trends that have marked this decline since the early post-Cold War era and discusses the increasingly severe strategic challenges this situation poses for American statecraft. It concludes with a series of practical recommendations for how the United States can manage its alliances amid ongoing changes in the global distribution of power, and how it can better position itself to compete in a global context in which its allies' strengths-while still considerable-are not as great as they once were.

AB  - This handbook provides a detailed analysis of threats and risk in the international system and of how governments and their intelligence services must adapt and function in order to manage the evolving security environment. This environment, now and for the foreseeable future, is characterised by complexity. The development of disruptive digital technologies; the vulnerability of critical national infrastructure; asymmetric threats such as terrorism; the privatisation of national intelligence capabilities: all have far reaching implications for security and risk management. The leading academics and practitioners who have contributed to this handbook have all done so with the objective of cutting through the complexity, and providing insight on the most pressing security, intelligence, and risk factors today. They explore the changing nature of conflict and crises; interaction of the global with the local; the impact of technological; the proliferation of hostile ideologies and the challenge this poses to traditional models of intelligence; and the impact of all these factors on governance and ethical frameworks. The handbook is an invaluable resource for students and professionals concerned with contemporary security and how national intelligence must adapt to remain effective.

AB  - This monograph provides an accessible introduction to the regional analysis of fractional diffusion processes. It begins with background coverage of fractional calculus, functional analysis, distributed parameter systems and relevant basic control theory. New research problems are then defined in terms of their actuation and sensing policies within the regional analysis framework. The results presented provide insight into the control-theoretic analysis of fractional-order systems for use in real-life applications such as hard-disk drives, sleep stage identification and classification, and unmanned aerial vehicle control. The results can also be extended to complex fractional-order distributed-parameter systems and various open questions with potential for further investigation are discussed. For instance, the problem of fractional order distributed-parameter systems with mobile actuators/sensors, optimal parameter identification, optimal locations/trajectory of actuators/sensors and regional actuation/sensing configurations are of great interest. The book’s use of illustrations and consistent examples throughout helps readers to understand the significance of the proposed fractional models and methodologies and to enhance their comprehension. The applications treated in the book run the gamut from environmental science to national security. Academics and graduate students working with cyber-physical and distributed systems or interested in the the applications of fractional calculus will find this book to be an instructive source of state-of-the-art results and inspiration for further research.

AB  - This edited volume provides scholars and practitioners with an in-depth examination of the role of civil-military cooperation in addressing hybrid threats. As they combine the simultaneous employment of conventional and non-conventional tools and target not only military objectives but governments and societies at large, hybrid threats cannot be countered solely by military means, but require an equally inclusive response encompassing a wide range of military and civilian actors. This book, which combines the perspectives of academics, military officers, and officials from international and non-governmental organisations, resorts to different case studies to illustrate the importance of civil-military cooperation in enhancing the resilience of NATO members and partners against a wide range of societal destabilization strategies, thereby contributing to the formulation of a civil-military response to hybrid threats.

AB  - This book captures the most exciting advances in the harnessing of space as a global resource. The authors track the growing number of space businesses and opportunities for investors, and the many possible benefits of spaceplanes, space stations and even space colonies. The authors also discuss the need for more regulatory reform. Companies like Planetary Resources are now forming to find mineral-rich asteroids and bring back new riches to Earth. Solar power satellites in the next few years will start to beam clean energy back to Earth, to meet the growing demands of a still-developing world. Innovative space industries are vital to the survival of modern human life, and the authors demonstrate what can be done to encourage the growing of the "New Space" frontier. From lassoing and then mining asteroids to developing new methods of defending the planet from space hazards and setting up new hotels and adventures for tourists in space, this new industry will have profound effects on Earth, especially on its economy. This book is based on a study of international experts commissioned ahead of the UNISPACE+50 meeting, having distilled the results of this comprehensive fact-finding process into a compact and very readable form. It can serve as an excellent starting point for understanding all the activities underway or planned to make space truly our next frontier.

AB  - This volume comprises a selection of works presented at the Numerical and Evolutionary Optimization (NEO 2016) workshop held in September 2016 in Tlalnepantla, Mexico. The development of powerful search and optimization techniques is of great importance in today’s world and requires researchers and practitioners to tackle a growing number of challenging real-world problems. In particular, there are two well-established and widely known fields that are commonly applied in this area: (i) traditional numerical optimization techniques and (ii) comparatively recent bio-inspired heuristics. Both paradigms have their unique strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to solve some challenging problems while still failing in others. The goal of the NEO workshop series is to bring together experts from these and related fields to discuss, compare and merge their complementary perspectives in order to develop fast and reliable hybrid methods that maximize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the underlying paradigms. In doing so, NEO promotes the development of new techniques that are applicable to a broader class of problems. Moreover, NEO fosters the understanding and adequate treatment of real-world problems particularly in emerging fields that affect all of us, such as healthcare, smart cities, big data, among many others. The extended papers presented in the book contribute to achieving this goal.

AB  - This book sets out the major social scientific approaches to the study of Special Operations Forces. Despite consistent downsizing, over the past two decades the armed forces of the industrial democracies have seen a huge growth in Special Operations Forces (SOF). Through increasing numbers of personnel and more frequent deployments, SOF units have wielded considerable influence in conflicts around the world, with senior SOF officers having led major strategic operations. This increased presence and unprecedented expansion for SOF is largely a result of the ‘new’ kinds of conflicts that have emerged in the 21st century. At the same time, even with this high profile in the military, policy and media and popular cultural arenas, there is relatively little social scientific research on SOF. This volume aims to fill this gap by providing a series of studies and analyses of SOF across the globe, since the end of World War II. Analysing SOF at the micro, mezzo and macro levels provides broad and diverse insights. Moreover, the volume deals with new issues raised by the use of such forces that include emerging modes of civilian control, innovative organizational forms and the special psychological characteristics necessitated by SOF operatives. It concludes with a discussion of a question which continues to be debated in today’s militaries: what makes SOF ‘special’? Filling a clear gap in the literature, this book will be of much interest to students of strategic studies, civil-military relations, irregular warfare, security studies, and international relations. 1.

AB  - This book helps decision makers grasp the importance, and applicability to business, of the new technologies and extended connectivity of systems that underlie what is becoming known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution: technologies and systems such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, 3D printing, the internet of things, virtual and augmented reality, big data and mobile networks.  The WEF, OECD and UN all agree that humanity is on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. As intelligent systems become integrated into every aspect of our lives this revolution will induce cultural and societal change of a magnitude hitherto unforeseen. These technologies challenge the values, customer experience and business propositions that have been the mainstay of almost every business and organization in existence. By redefining and encapsulating new value structures with emerging intelligent technologies, new innovative models are being created, and brought to market. Understanding the potential and impact of these changes will be a fundamental leadership requirement over the coming years. Skilton and Hovsepian provide decision makers with practical, independent and authoritative guidance to help them prepare for the changes we are all likely to witness due to the rapid convergence of technological advances. In short, bite-sized, nuggets, with frameworks supported by a deep set of practical and up-to-the-minute case studies, they shine light on the new business models and enterprise architectures emerging as businesses seek to build strategies to thrive within this brave new world.

AB  - This work examines violence in the age of the terror wars with an eye toward the technologies of governance that create, facilitate, and circulate that violence. In performing a rhetorical cartography that explores the rise of the US armed drone program as well as moments of resistive violence that occurred during the Arab Spring directed at generating a counter-hegemony by Muslim populations, Hayes argues that the problem of the global terror wars is best addressed by a rhetorical understanding of the ways that governments, as well as individual subjects, turn to violence as a response to, or product of, the post September 11th terror society. When political examinations of terrorism are facilitated through understandings of discourse, Hayes argues, clearer maps emerge of how violence functions to offer mechanisms by which governing bodies, and their subjects, evaluate the success or failure of the “War on Terror.” This book will be of interest to public policymakers and informed general readers as well as students and scholars in the fields of rhetoric, political theory, critical geography, US foreign relations/policy, war and peace studies, and cultural studies.

AB  - Posthumanism represents a significant new research direction both for International Relations and the social sciences. It emerges from questions about inter-species relations which challenge dominant perceptions of what it means to be human. Rather than seeing the human species as ‘in nature’ posthumanist thinking considers the species as ‘of nature’. The work of posthumanist thinkers has sought to dispute accepted notions of what it means to be human, raising profound questions about our relations with the rest of nature. The volume commences with an overview of the influence thinkers have had on the development of posthumanist thinking. Key ideas in International Relations are interrogated and reconceptualised and specific case studies are presented with a focus on inter-species relations. The work allows for a consideration of the limits of the posthumanist move and provides space for critics to argue that such an approach opens the discipline up to a biological determinism, and that a focus on inter-human relations should mark the boundaries of the discipline. The essays collected in this volume provide an overview of contributions from posthumanist thinkers with the particular intention of providing a succinct introduction to the area and should appeal to scholars and students in Politics, IR and philosophy.

AB  - Abstract
            Weather and hydrological extremes, which may be exacerbated by climate variability and change, severely stressed natural, engineered, and human systems. What makes these climate hazards particularly worrisome, however, is their rapidly changing nature, along with our lack of understanding of those hazard attributes that may matter the most for impact analyses. Thus, our understanding of climate variables is less reliable at finer resolutions, and our insights are less credible for extremes such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, and tornadoes. The interaction of climate hazards with increasing vulnerability, for example, owing to aging of infrastructures, and growing exposure, for example, owing to population growth and increasing rates of urbanization, enhances the challenge. The impacts of climate hazards, and hence preparedness and management of natural hazards as well as climate adaptation and to a great extent mitigation, depend critically on the state of infrastructures. Probabilistic risk assessments, an approach based on threat, vulnerability, and consequences, have long been used to prioritize engineering solutions and resource allocations for developing new or retrofitting existing infrastructures. However, there is a growing realization that a broader community and regional resilience centric perspective may be necessary. The new perspective needs to consider the essential functionality enabled by the infrastructures, as well as brittleness, recovery potential, and risks in terms of those functions. In addition, the perspective would need to consider a holistic framework, which embraces the visualization of critical functions and cascading failures across infrastructure sectors to novel engineering design and standards, along with economic incentives and metrics as well as best practices in organization and governance relevant for preparedness and response.

AB  - Weather and hydrological extremes, which may be exacerbated by climate variability and change, severely stressed natural, engineered, and human systems. What makes these climate hazards particularly worrisome, however, is their rapidly changing nature, along with our lack of understanding of those hazard attributes that may matter the most for impact analyses. Thus, our understanding of climate variables is less reliable at finer resolutions, and our insights are less credible for extremes such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, and tornadoes. The interaction of climate hazards with increasing vulnerability, for example, owing to aging of infrastructures, and growing exposure, for example, owing to population growth and increasing rates of urbanization, enhances the challenge. The impacts of climate hazards, and hence preparedness and management of natural hazards as well as climate adaptation and to a great extent mitigation, depend critically on the state of infrastructures. Probabilistic risk assessments, an approach based on threat, vulnerability, and consequences, have long been used to prioritize engineering solutions and resource allocations for developing new or retrofitting existing infrastructures. However, there is a growing realization that a broader community and regional resilience centric perspective may be necessary. The new perspective needs to consider the essential functionality enabled by the infrastructures, as well as brittleness, recovery potential, and risks in terms of those functions. In addition, the perspective would need to consider a holistic framework, which embraces the visualization of critical functions and cascading failures across infrastructure sectors to novel engineering design and standards, along with economic incentives and metrics as well as best practices in organization and governance relevant for preparedness and response. CrimeStat is a spatial statistics and visualization program that interfaces with desktop GIS packages. It is a stand-alone Windows program for the analysis of crime incident locations and can interface with most desktop GIS programs. Its aim is to provide statistical tools to help law enforcement agencies and criminal justice researchers in their crime mapping efforts. The program has many statistical tools, including centrographic, distance analysis, hot spot analysis, space-time analysis, interpolation, Journey-to-Crime estimation, and crime travel demand modeling routines. The program writes calculated objects to GIS files that can be imported into a GIS program, including shape, MIF/MID, BNA, and ASCII. The National Institute of Justice is the distributor of CrimeStat and makes it available for free to analysts, researchers, educators, and students (The program is available at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/crimestat). The program is distributed along with a manual that describes each of the statistics and gives examples of their use (Levine 2007a).

AB  - This book covers the security and safety of CBRNE assets and management, and illustrates which risks may emerge and how to counter them through an enhanced risk management approach. It also tackles the CBRNE-Cyber threats, their risk mitigation measures and the relevance of raising awareness and education enforcing a CBRNE-Cy security culture. The authors present international instruments and legislation to deal with these threats, for instance the UNSCR1540. The authors address a multitude of stakeholders, and have a multidisciplinary nature dealing with cross-cutting areas like the convergence of biological and chemical, the development of edging technologies, and in the cyber domain, the impelling risks due to the use of malwares against critical subsystems of CBRN facilities. Examples are provided in this book. Academicians, diplomats, technicians and engineers working in the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, explosive and cyber fields will find this book valuable as a reference. Students studying in these related fields will also find this book useful as a reference.

AB  - This book aims at finding some answers to the questions: What is the influence of humans in controlling CAD and how much is human in control of its surroundings? How far does our reach as humans really go? Do the complex algorithms that we use for city planning nowadays live up to their expectations and do they offer enough quality? How much data do we have and can we control? Are today’s inventions reversing the humanly controlled algorithms into a space where humans are controlled by the algorithms? Are processing power, robots for the digital environment and construction in particular not only there to rediscover what we already knew and know or do they really bring us further into the fields of constructing and architecture? The chapter authors were invited speakers at the 6th Symposium "Design Modelling Symposium: Humanizing Digital Reality", which took place in  Ensa-Versailles, France from 16 - 20 September 2017.

AB  - Scientists and engineers have long been aware of the tension between narrow specialization and multidisciplinary cooperation, but now a major transformation is in process that will require technical fields to combine far more effectively than formerly in the service of human benefit. This handbook will catalog all the ways this can be accomplished and the reasons it must be. Nature is a single coherent system and diverse methods of scientific and engineering investigations should reflect this interlinked and dynamic unity. Accordingly, general concepts and ideas should be developed systematically in interdependence, with cause-and-effect pathways, for improved outcomes in knowledge, technology and applications. At the same time, industrial and social applications rely on integration of disciplines and unification of knowledge. Thus, convergence is both a fundamental principle of nature and a timely opportunity for human progress. This handbook will represent the culmination of fifteen years of workshops, conferences and publications that initially explored the connections between nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and new technologies based on cognitive science. A constant emphasis on human benefit then drew in the social sciences, even as shared scientific and ethical principles brought in sustainability of the Earth environment and the challenge of equitable economic advancement. The intellectual contributions of literally hundreds of scientists and engineers established a number of research methods and analytical principles that could unite disparate fields. The culmination has been called Convergence of Knowledge and Technology for the benefit of Society (CKTS), defined as the escalating and transformative interactions among seemingly different disciplines, technologies, communities and domains of human activity to achieve mutual compatibility, synergism and integration.

AB  - This book is based on the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the Global Space Governance study commissioned by the 2014 Montreal Declaration that called upon civil society, academics, governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders to undertake an international interdisciplinary study. The study took three years to complete. It examines the drivers of space regulations and standards, key regulatory problems, and especially addresses possible improvements in global space governance. The world's leading experts led the drafting of chapters, with input from academics and knowledgeable professionals in the public and private sectors, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations from all the regions of the world with over 80 total participants. This book and areas identified for priority action are to be presented to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and it is hoped will be considered directly or indirectly at the UNISPACE+50 event in Vienna, Austria, in 2018. The report, a collective work of all the contributors, includes objective analysis and frank statements expressed without pressure of political, national, and occupational concerns or interest. It is peer-reviewed and carefully edited to ensure its accuracy, preciseness, and readability. It is expected that the study and derivative recommendations will form the basis for deliberations and decisions at international conferences and meetings around the world on the theme of global space governance. This will hopefully include future discussion at the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.

It provides up-to-date information on emerging topics such as spatial big data, smart-phone GIS, urban computing and mobile recommender systems. It also expands the first edition’s rich set of GIS-related commercial and societal applications such as geo-targeting, geo-fencing and understanding climate changes, while enabling more comprehensive coverage of classical GIS topics such as map projections, global positioning systems and spatial cognition. The entries explain the key software, data sets and processes used by geographers and computational scientists. Additionally, the reference emphasizes the role of GIS in business and mobile intelligence. By offering more diversified GIS-related topics from theory and research than most of the other available literature, the authors equip newcomers to the field with principles as well as applications. With an accessible breadth of content and intuitive A-Z organization, this new edition of the encyclopedia is an invaluable reference for newcomers to the field of GIS, as well as researchers, students, developers and professionals who are interested in exploring this new dynamic area. Praise For The First Edition: "The focus here, however, is on the mathematical and computational aspects of GIS … . This is very welcome to those practitioners who have been less exposed to some of the mathematical and computational aspects of GIS. This is also very welcome to the researcher or graduate student within any of the interdisciplinary areas that use GIS. … I highly recommend it." (Pascal V. Calarco, ACM Computing Reviews, November, 2008) "This single-volume reference work is a highly welcome … addition to the rapidly advancing field of geographic information systems. Peer-reviewed entries from over 300 contributors cover 41 topical subfields, with an overall emphasis on computational aspects of GIS. The volume is adequately illustrated with 723 figures and 90 tables in black and white. A full bibliography and concise list of entry terms are provided at the back of the work. … Summing Up: Highly recommended. Upper-division geography students through professionals." (C. E. Smith, CHOICE, Vol. 45 (11), 2008) "The encyclopedia is divided into 41 fields, each one an important sub-area within GIS. ... the editors’ organization of the material and comprehensive and systematic approach are superb and shall give students, eager readers as well as researchers an understanding of the topics in quite full depth and breadth. … is lavishly illustrated with figures, graphs and tables, the design and execution of which are as perfect as the material they illustrate. … it is sturdy and opens out nicely for study and reference." (Current Engineering Practice, 2008).

AB  - This Handbook presents a complete and rigorous overview of the fundamentals, methods and applications of the multidisciplinary field of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), providing an exhaustive, one-stop reference work and a state-of-the-art description of GNSS as a key technology for science and society at large. All global and regional satellite navigation systems, both those currently in operation and those under development (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, IRNSS/NAVIC, SBAS), are examined in detail. The functional principles of receivers and antennas, as well as the advanced algorithms and models for GNSS parameter estimation, are rigorously discussed. The book covers the broad and diverse range of land, marine, air and space applications, from everyday GNSS to high-precision scientific applications and provides detailed descriptions of the most widely used GNSS format standards, covering receiver formats as well as IGS product and meta-data formats.The full coverage of the field of GNSS is presented in seven parts, from its fundamentals, through the treatment of global and regional navigation satellite systems, of receivers and antennas, and of algorithms and models, up to the broad and diverse range of applications in the areas of positioning and navigation, surveying, geodesy and geodynamics, and remote sensing and timing. Each chapter is written by international experts and amply illustrated with figures and photographs, making the book an invaluable resource for scientists, engineers, students and institutions alike.
