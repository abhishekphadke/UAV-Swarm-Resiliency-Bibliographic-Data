AB  - Data and information obtained from low-cost uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as 'drones', can be used to support integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and sustainable development at the coast. Several recent studies in various disciplines, including ecology, engineering, and several branches of physical and human geography, describe the applications of UAV technology with practical coastal management potential, yet the extent to which such data can contribute to these activities remains underexplored. The main objective of this paper is to collate this knowledge to highlight the areas in which UAV technology can contribute to ICZM and can influence the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the coast. We focus on applications with practical potential for coastal management activities and assess their accessibility in terms of cost, ease of use, and maturity. We identified ten (out of the 17) SDGs to which UAVs can contribute data and information. Examples of applications include surveillance of illegal fishing and aquaculture activities, seaweed resource assessments, cost-estimation of post-storm damages, and documentation of natural and cultural heritage sites under threat from, for example, erosion and sea-level rise. An awareness of how UAVs can contribute to ICZM, as well as the limitations of the technology, can help coastal practitioners to evaluate their options for future management activities.

AB  - Recent scientific and technological advancements driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), distributed computing and data communication technologies have opened up a vast range of opportunities in many scientific fields-spanning from fast, reliable and efficient data communication to large-scale cloud/edge computing and intelligent big data analytics. Technological innovations and developments in these areas have also enabled many opportunities in the space industry. The successful Mars landing of NASA's Perseverance rover on 18 February 2021 represents another giant leap for humankind in space exploration. Emerging research and developments of connectivity and computing technologies in IoT for space/non-terrestrial environments is expected to yield significant benefits in the near future. This survey paper presents a broad overview of the area and provides a look-ahead of the opportunities made possible by IoT and space-based technologies. We first survey the current developments of IoT and space industry, and identify key challenges and opportunities in these areas. We then review the state-of-the-art and discuss future opportunities for IoT developments, deployment and integration to support future endeavors in space exploration.

AB  - Multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an imperative role in many real-world applications in a variety of scenarios characterized by a high density of obstacles with different heights. Due to the complicated operation areas of UAVs and complex constraints associated with the assigned mission, there should be a suitable path to fly. Therefore, the most relevant challenge is how to plan a flyable path for a UAV without collisions with obstacles. This paper demonstrates how a flyable and continuous trajectory was constructed by using any-angle pathfinding algorithms, which are Basic Theta*, Lazy Theta*, and Phi* algorithms for a multirotor UAV in a cluttered environment. The three algorithms were modified by adopting a modified cost function during their implementation that considers the elevation of nodes. First, suitable paths are generated by using a modified version of the three algorithms. After that, four Bézier curves-based approaches are proposed to smooth the generated paths to be converted to flyable paths (trajectories). To determine the most suitable approach, particularly when searching for an optimal and collision-free trajectory design, an innovative evaluation process is proposed and applied in a variety of different size environments. The evaluation process results show high success rates of the four approaches; however, the approach with the highest success rate is adopted. Finally, based on the results of the evaluation process, a novel algorithm is proposed to increase the efficiency of the selected approach to the optimality in the construction process of the trajectory.

AB  - Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is one of the most important extensions to TCP that enables the use of multiple paths in data transmissions for a TCP connection. In MPTCP, the end hosts transmit data across a number of TCP subflows simultaneously on one connection. MPTCP can sufficiently utilize the bandwidth resources to improve the transmission efficiency while providing TCP fairness to other TCP connections. Meanwhile, it also offers resilience due to multipath data transfers. MPTCP attracts tremendous attention from the academic and industry field due to the explosive data growth in recent times and limited network bandwidth for each single available communication interface. The vehicular Internet-of-Things systems, such as cooperative autonomous driving, require reliable high speed data transmission and robustness. MPTCP could be a promising approach to solve these challenges. In this paper, we first conduct a brief survey of existing MPTCP studies and give a brief overview to multipath routing. Then we discuss the significance technical challenges in applying MPTCP for vehicular networks and point out future research directions.

AB  - This overview gravitates on research achievements that have recently emerged from the confluence between Big Data technologies and bio-inspired computation. A manifold of reasons can be identified for the profitable synergy between these two paradigms, all rooted on the adaptability, intelligence and robustness that biologically inspired principles can provide to technologies aimed to manage, retrieve, fuse and process Big Data efficiently. We delve into this research field by first analyzing in depth the existing literature, with a focus on advances reported in the last few years. This prior literature analysis is complemented by an identification of the new trends and open challenges in Big Data that remain unsolved to date, and that can be effectively addressed by bio-inspired algorithms. As a second contribution, this work elaborates on how bio-inspired algorithms need to be adapted for their use in a Big Data context, in which data fusion becomes crucial as a previous step to allow processing and mining several and potentially heterogeneous data sources. This analysis allows exploring and comparing the scope and efficiency of existing approaches across different problems and domains, with the purpose of identifying new potential applications and research niches. Finally, this survey highlights open issues that remain unsolved to date in this research avenue, alongside a prescription of recommendations for future research.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human-robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.

AB  - Effective marine oil spill management (MOSM) is crucial to minimize the catastrophic impacts of oil spills. MOSM is a complex system affected by various factors, such as characteristics of spilled oil and environmental conditions. Oil spill detection, characterization, and monitoring; risk evaluation; response selection and process optimization; and waste management are the key components of MOSM demanding timely decision-making. Applying robust computational techniques based on real-time data (e.g., satellite and aerial observations) and historical records of oil spill incidents may considerably facilitate decision-making processes. Various soft-computing and artificial intelligence-based models and mathematical techniques have been used for the implementation of MOSM's components. This study presents a review of literature published since 2010 on the application of computational techniques in MOSM. A statistical evaluation is performed concerning the temporal distribution of papers, publishers' engagement, research subfields, countries of studies, and selected case studies. Key findings reported in the literature are summarized for two main practices in MOSM: spill detection, characterization, and monitoring; and spill management and response optimization. Potential gaps in applying computational techniques in MOSM have been identified, and a holistic computational-based framework has been suggested for effective MOSM.

AB  - The distributed resilient tracking problem for multiagent systems (MASs) is investigated in the presence of actuator/sensor faults over directed topology. Both actuator fault and sensor fault are taken into account. Meanwhile, using the local information, the fault compensators are introduced. Then, based on the fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs) and modification technique of adaptive law, a novel distributed adaptive resilient control protocol is developed, which can compensate the effect of faults on the actuator and sensor. It turns out that all signals of MASs are bounded, while the tracking errors enter an adjustable bounded region around the origin. Toward the end, two simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB  - Advances in Data Science permeate every field of Transportation Science and Engineering, resulting in developments in the transportation sector that are data-driven. Nowadays, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) could be arguably approached as a "story" intensively producing and consuming large amounts of data. A diversity of sensing devices densely spread over the infrastructure, vehicles or the travelers' personal devices act as sources of data flows that are eventually fed into software running on automatic devices, actuators or control systems producing, in turn, complex information flows among users, traffic managers, data analysts, traffic modeling scientists, etc. These information flows provide enormous opportunities to improve model development and decision-making. This work aims to describe how data, coming from diverse ITS sources, can be used to learn and adapt data-driven models for efficiently operating ITS assets, systems and processes; in other words, for data-based models to fully become <i>actionable</i>. Grounded in this described data modeling pipeline for ITS, we define the characteristics, engineering requisites and challenges intrinsic to its three compounding stages, namely, data fusion, adaptive learning and model evaluation. We deliberately generalize model learning to be adaptive, since, in the core of our paper is the firm conviction that most learners will have to adapt to the ever-changing phenomenon scenario underlying the majority of ITS applications. Finally, we provide a prospect of current research lines within Data Science that can bring notable advances to data-based ITS modeling, which will eventually bridge the gap towards the practicality and actionability of such models.

AB  - Due to highly dynamic links and unstable wireless channels, designing reliable and efficient routing protocols for UAV swarm networks is challenging. In this paper, a modified virtual potential field method is developed to coordinate the UAV swarm and provide local topology information. Both coordination and mutual influence between UAVs are taken into consideration for virtual force calculation. Next, a new Virtual-Potential-Field-based Cooperative Opportunistic Routing (VPFCOR) protocol is proposed. VPFCOR comprehensively combines three main metrics for candidate ordering, i.e., forwarding distance, virtual force and remaining energy. With these metrics, VPFCOR can effectively adapt to different tasks, take smaller routing overhead and meet the real-time requirement. Simulation results are presented to obtain the optimal parameter settings and validate the effectiveness of our proposed protocol.

AB  - Over the last decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) domain has grown dramatically, from ultra-low-power hardware design to cloud-based solutions, and now, with the rise of 5G technology, a new horizon for edge computing on IoT devices will be introduced. A wide range of communication technologies has steadily evolved in recent years, representing a diverse range of domain areas and communication specifications. Because of the heterogeneity of technology and interconnectivity, the true realisation of the IoT ecosystem is currently hampered by multiple dynamic integration challenges. In this context, several emerging IoT domains necessitate a complete re-modeling, design, and standardisation from the ground up in order to achieve seamless IoT ecosystem integration. The Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT), Internet of Space-Things (IoST), Internet of Underwater-Things (IoUT) and Social Internet of Things (SIoT) are investigated in this paper with a broad future scope based on their integration and ability to source other IoT domains by highlighting their application domains, state-of-the-art research, and open challenges. To the best of our knowledge, there is little or no information on the current state of these ecosystems, which is the motivating factor behind this article. Finally, the paper summarises the integration of these ecosystems with current IoT domains and suggests future directions for overcoming the challenges.

AB  - The paper implements experimental testing and development of possible options for self-organizing wireless networks for a swarm of drones for telecommunications services. Experimental testing of a swarm of drones was implemented in two relay scenarios: with the help of metalized reflectors and active with the use of additional SDR radio units. A test suite based on programmable modules has been developed. This allows them to be periodically used on network drones and in a ground command and control post. In this case, only the software of the built-in modules is changed to them. The set under consideration can form a scenario in which it is possible to implement cooperative relaying of a signal for a remote drone through the swarm nodes when direct communication with ground control and monitoring station is impossible.

AB  - A human-swarm cooperative system, which mixes multiple robots and a human supervisor to form a mission team, has been widely used for emergent scenarios such as criminal tracking and victim assistance. These scenarios are related to human safety and require a robot team to quickly transit from the current undergoing task into the new emergent task. This sudden mission change brings difficulty in robot motion adjustment and increases the risk of performance degradation of the swarm. Trust in human-human collaboration reflects a general expectation of the collaboration; based on the trust humans mutually adjust their behaviors for better teamwork. Inspired by this, in this research, a trust-aware reflective control (Trust-R), was developed for a robot swarm to understand the collaborative mission and calibrate its motions accordingly for better emergency response. Typical emergent tasks “transit between area inspection tasks”, “response to emergent target - car accident” in social security with eight fault-related situations were designed to simulate robot deployments. A human user study with 50 volunteers was conducted to model trust and assess swarm performance. Trust-R's effectiveness in supporting a robot team for emergency response was validated by improved task performance and increased trust scores.

AB  - The Sensor Open Systems Architecture™ (SOSA) Consortium seeks to decrease costs and increase performance of large-scale, standalone sensor systems like multi-sensor Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) or Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), typically hosted on manned aircraft platforms. However, the greatest benefit of the SOSA Reference Architecture—interoperability—could also fuel the future of small, expendable systems such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and wearables. Not surprisingly, a sensor architecture crafted for large systems can be a challenge to host on small or distributed hardware. This paper presents three examples of the appeal and challenges inherent in defining an open architecture for the world of small sensors by asking, “Where does that module live?” The first example presents the case of sensors on small UAVs; for this case, the SOSA Technical Standard defines classes of connectors, in the vein of SAE AS6169™A, as well as mechanical interfaces. Interoperability and standardized interfaces would make sensors for UAVs easier and cheaper to assemble and deploy. However, the current SOSA Components and Modules definitions can be awkward for small UAV sensors. For instance, a small sensor may not contain a processor for hosting Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) on the sensor, but instead the platform may contain that processor, hence distributing the SOSA Modules onto different hardware elements on and off the host platform. The second example presents the case of using VITA 74.0-complaint hardware (VNX) for wearable sensor applications. It is appealing to apply the SOSA Reference Architecture to this new paradigm, but this tiny form factor as a part of the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) may require a new contextualization of the boundaries of a reference architecture that includes distributed composable hardware elements. The third and last example presents the case of a swarm of sensor-enabled UAVs. The swarming sensor concept encourages yet a further reconceptualization of the SOSA Reference Architecture boundaries and the SOSA Data Model. As an open architecture originally intended for standalone systems and sensors, the SOSA Reference Architecture naturally assumes a sensor communicates primarily to the platform and never directly to other sensors. However, in order for a swarm of UAV-based sensors to reach maximum effectivity, the SOSA Reference Architecture could potentially extend its scope to include a swarm class with SOSA Modules that might not live either on the platform nor in a single sensor—they could be shared entities or organized in a hierarchy. These three examples illustrate how a forward-looking sensor open architecture can evolve to drive the future of smaller applications by expanding into these novel realms to provide a smart, flexible, small-form factor architecture.

AB  - Multi-agent systems (MAS) promote developments in various applications such as rescue, tracking, and health care. Through the cooperation of multiple agents, the system can emerge beyond the ability of individual intelligence. However, considering the flexibility and mobility of agents, accountability and trusted interactions among agents have become mandatory aspects. One of the challenges in developing multi-agent systems is the design of appropriate coordination strategies. In this paper, we leverage the features of Ethereum architecture and propose a novel Clique-based distributed multi-agent system. The advantages of our system include secure, self-governing, and tamper-proof properties. We implement our system framework and test custom smart contracts based on a private blockchain in Ethereum. The experimental results show that the resource consumption of our proposed scheme is reasonable and feasible.

AB  - When configuring a cyber-physical system (CPS) for operating in large open areas and connecting distributed autonomous devices to it via wireless communication channels, it is necessary to take into account the threats that can disrupt the functioning of the CPS. This paper provides a classification of threats that directly affect the CPS operation. It was revealed that the most dangerous threats are associated with the influence of the environment. The paper proposes a solution to minimize the impact of the environment on the operation of the CPS. The growth in the number of heterogeneous devices with different properties and actual purposes, interacting over a wireless network, leads to the emergence of the problem of providing a speed-satisfactory method for configuring a wireless communication network between heterogeneous devices in a distributed CPS. To solve this problem, algorithm for the radio survey of the CPS territory using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) was developed.

AB  - The impressive advancements in embedded systems and the integration of new types of smart devices into the Internet of Things (IoT) continue to revolutionize the communication technologies. Gradually, such devices are enriched with additional capabilities (e.g., sense, learn, reason, move, act on the environment) beyond classic connectivity services. However, there are no unified and coherent software architectures to seamlessly integrate and manage high-end devices. This work envisages a novel architectural framework, ITHACA: IoT High-end Autonomous Cooper-Ative framework, for 5G and beyond communications toward seamless integration of autonomous and intelligent devices. The framework offers necessary functional enrichments on top of existing architecture involving functions, mechanisms, algorithms, and protocols. The usefulness of the proposed ITHACA framework is corroborated considering a recent Industry 4.0 use case of aerial robotics pertaining to design of an intelligent industrial infrastructure inspection system.

AB  - There is an increasing demand for unmanned systems to perform a wide range of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The demand for small unmanned air systems (SUAS) results from reducing costs, increasing use for stand-off monitoring, and replacing piloted aircraft in disaster responses. With reduced size come more restrictive payload weights, limiting the number and diversity of sensors that can be located on a single platform. As a result, platforms must coordinate to share and leverage multi-sensor data over limited communications channels. This paper presents an on-device design and implementation of a distributed joint manifold learning (DJML) approach for improved object detection, classification, and identification (DCI). The DJML design addresses the joint utilization of sensor data from a collection of decentralized, heterogeneous sensing platforms (e.g., sensor swarm) in dynamic environments with constrained communications. This paper focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the hardware tradeoffs for distributed device mechanisms: drone-carried sensing, communication, and computing. Different sensor modality data are preloaded on SD (secure digital) cards and sequentially processed on local devices to emulate the additional sensor modalities. The in-lab testing results demonstrate the robustness and resiliency of on-device decentralized DCI under various conditions of sensor placement and communication degradation between platforms.

AB  - Rapid advances that improve flood management have facilitated the disaster response by providing first aid services, finding safe routes, maintaining communication and developing flood maps. Different technologies such as image processing, satellite imagery, synthetic imagery and integrated approaches have been extensively analysed in the literature for disaster operations. There is a need to review cutting-edge technologies for flood management. This paper presents a review of the latest advancements in the flood management domain based on image processing, artificial intelligence and integrated approaches with a focus on post-disaster. It answers the following research questions: (1) What are the latest developments in image processing for flood management in a post-disaster scenario? (2) What are the latest techniques for flood management based on artificial intelligence in a post-disaster scenario? (3) What are the existing gaps in the selected technologies for post-disaster? (4) How can the authorities improve the existing post-disaster management operation with cutting-edge technologies? A novel framework has been proposed to optimise flood management with the application of a holistic approach.

AB  - Problems such as the control of massive swarms or MANET radios in a Battlespace on the order of tens of thousands of entities is challenging with conventional approaches. Entities that enter or leave this space need to have either some means of coordination or known constraints. Moreover, each entity should have some limited awareness of the relative positioning of all the others, without the massive computational expense incurred by a combinatorial explosion. This may rule out the quantum state space type of approach where each entity is a computationally-unique unit vector. To control such behaviors, and allow self-organizing MANET relay nodes as well as collective swarm control, the author uses a topological structure based upon deterministic chaos—the fractal. Constraining the entities to “believe” that they exist only within the boundaries of an adaptive fractal forces their topological layout to map to topological clusters. The invariant features of a fractal topology allow each node to compute the IFS (Iterative Function System) to effectively “know” the relative positions of all the other entities, and form adaptive, self-healing MANET or swarm clusters. One of many possible equations for the adaptive fractal is given, which computationally is of O(n). Since it uses one floating point number, the computations for each entity/node to determine the relative positions of all Battlespace entities is trivial, therefore each entity can achieve situational awareness in near-realtime. A simulation of the dynamics for different adaptive fractal topologies written in Mathematica, can be demonstrated during the paper presentation.

AB  - We propose a distributed victim-detection algorithm through visual information on quadrotors using convolutional neuronal networks (CNN) in a search and rescue environment. Describing the navigation algorithm, which allows quadrotors to avoid collisions. Secondly, when one quadrotor detects a possible victim, it causes its closest neighbors to disconnect from the main swarm and form a new sub-swarm around the victim, which validates the victim’s status. Thus, a formation control that permits to acquire information is performed based on the well-known rendezvous consensus algorithm. Finally, images are processed using CNN identifying potential victims in the area. Given the uncertainty of the victim detection measurement among quadrotors’ cameras in the image processing, estimation consensus (EC) and max-estimation consensus (M-EC) algorithms are proposed focusing on agreeing over the victim detection estimation. We illustrate that M-EC delivers better results than EC in scenarios with poor visibility and uncertainty produced by fire and smoke. The algorithm proves that distributed fashion can obtain a more accurate result in decision-making on whether or not there is a victim, showing robustness under uncertainties and wrong measurements in comparison when a single quadrotor performs the mission. The well-functioning of the algorithm is evaluated by carrying out a simulation using V-Rep.

AB  - Adaptive Navigation (AN) control strategies allow an agent to autonomously alter its trajectory based on realtime measurements of the environment. Compared to conventional navigation methods, these techniques can reduce required time and energy to explore scalar characteristics of unknown and dynamic regions of interest (e.g., temperature, concentration level). Multiple Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) approaches to AN can improve performance by exploiting synchronized spatially-dispersed measurements to generate realtime information regarding the structure of the local scalar field, which is then used to inform navigation decisions. This article presents initial results of a comprehensive program to develop, verify, and experimentally implement mission-level AN capabilities in three-dimensional (3D) space using our unique multilayer control architecture for groups of vehicles. Using our flexible formation control system, we build upon our prior 2D AN work and provide new contributions to 3D scalar field AN by a) demonstrating a wide range of 3D AN capabilities using a unified, multilayer control architecture, b) extending multivehicle 2D AN control primitives to navigation in 3D scalar fields, and c) introducing state-based sequencing of these primitive AN functions to execute 3D mission-level capabilities such as isosurface mapping and plume following. We verify functionality using high-fidelity simulations of multicopter drone clusters, accounting for vehicle dynamics, outdoor wind gust disturbances, position sensor inaccuracy, and scalar field sensor noise. This paper presents the multilayer architecture for multivehicle formation control, the 3D AN control primitives, the sequencing approaches for specific mission-level capabilities, and simulation results that demonstrate these functions.

This paper introduces the design and analysis of a class of multirotor airframes with the capability of in-plane maneuverability and direct decoupled 6-DoF control which allow for low profile sensor payload integration without the need for a gimbal as well as predictable and safe flight in confined spaces such as tunnels and collapsed buildings. The case study of a hexrotor airframe is presented with its layout optimized via the methodology from the authors' previous work. The actuator combinations are tested and selected based on the performance metrics defined by authors, and utilized to restart the layout optimization. The aerodynamic performance of the platform is evaluated in several closed-quarter flight scenarios using CFD and compared with that of other airframe configurations. The structure of the single hollow monocoque shell is proposed and validated to obtain the desired shell thickness for the monocoque frame based on modal analyses and finite element methods. Finally, the flight controller developed by the authors is implemented and initial flight tests are conducted to validate the full actuation and a few more flight tests are to be done in the near future.

AB  - Drone technology is developing very rapidly. Flying devices accomplishing various applications are becoming an integral part of our daily life undoubtedly. Drones are characterized by extreme mobility, decent computing power, scalability, and a very short lifetime due to energy constraints. The rise of drones inevitably enabled swarms and drone networking applications. Drone networks is a path-breaking subclass of flying ad-hoc networks with unique capabilities and specific requirements. One very important challenge with swarms is the device authentication problem, in other words, proving the identity of a single or a group of drones that request to join the swarm. In this paper, we tackle this emerging problem and propose a novel context-aware mutual authentication protocol. The proposed protocol provides authentication for groups of drones and supports recovering a swarm in case of network separation. Likewise, the protocol can handle drone joins and leaves. Moreover, the protocol is not dependent on network infrastructure, secure storage, and secure channels. We tested the protocol using an automated formal security protocol verification tool, called Scyther. The tests resulted in the complete verification of the authentication and secrecy claims for arbitrary network instances and all defined use-cases. The protocol is also shown to have proven performance advantages over the existing schemes.

AB  - The operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imposes various challenges on radio spectrum management to achieve safe operation, efficient spectrum utilization, and coexistence with legacy wireless networks. Current spectrum schemes have limitations when applied to UAV networks due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks that require adaptive spectrum decisions and robust schemes that provide seamless and reliable services. Existing surveys mostly focus on UAV applications, channel models, and security challenges, with a lack of studies on spectrum management in the context of UAV networks. Further, current spectrum efforts focus on terrestrial networks that feature fixed infrastructure and less dynamicity as compared to UAV networks. This motivates the need to revisit existing approaches and identify suitable schemes that allow for the rapid integration of UAVs with existing wireless technologies. Motivated by this observation, this article presents a comprehensive survey on spectrum management for UAV operations. It identifies suitable management schemes that align with UAV features and requirements to enable safe and efficient usage of the radio spectrum. The article assumes coexistence with prevalent wireless technologies that occupy the spectrum. It first presents the ruling from policymakers and regulators and discusses operation bands and radio interfaces. It then introduces deployment scenarios (applications and architectures) as standalone or heterogeneous networks. This is followed by a systematic structure for the management tools that employ deterministic, opportunistic, and competitive schemes. In addition, network monitoring, patrolling, and enforcement schemes are identified. The survey also specifies key tools that can be leveraged for spectrum management solutions such as optimization and blockchain. Finally, it recognizes open research directions and challenges that need to be tackled to advance UAV communications.

AB  - Modern 5G services with stringent reliability and latency requirements such as smart healthcare and industrial automation have become possible through the advancement of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). However, the rigidity of ground MEC and its susceptibility to infrastructure failure would prevent satisfying the resiliency and strict requirements of those services. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed for providing flexible edge computing capability through UAV-mounted cloudlets, harnessing their advantages such as mobility, low-cost, and line-of-sight communication. However, UAV-mounted cloudlets may have failure rates that would impact mission-critical applications, necessitating a novel study for the provisioned reliability considering UAV node reliability and task redundancy. In this paper, we investigate the novel problem of UAV-aided ultra-reliable low-latency computation offloading which would enable future IoT services with strict requirements. We aim at maximizing the rate of served requests, by optimizing the UAVs’ positions, the offloading decisions, and the allocated resources while respecting the stringent latency and reliability requirements. To do so, the problem is divided into two phases, the first being a planning problem to optimize the placement of UAVs and the second an operational problem to make optimized offloading and resource allocation decisions with constrained UAVs’ energy. We formulate both problems associated with each phase as non-convex mixed-integer programs, and due to their non-convexity, we propose a two-stage approximate algorithm where the two problems are transformed into approximate convex programs. Further, we approach the problem considering the task partitioning model which will be prevalent in 5G networks. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate the efficiency of our solution considering various scenarios, and compare it to other baseline approaches.

In this article, after reviewing research activities on NTNs, we present the characteristics and enabling technologies of NTNs in the 6G landscape and shed light on the challenges in the field that are still open for future research. As a case study, we evaluate the performance of an NTN scenario in which aerial/space vehicles use millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies to provide access connectivity to on-the-ground mobile terminals as a function of different networking configurations.

AB  - Over the past decade, unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs; widely known as drones) are quickly being deployed in various civilian as well as military applications. Drones can self-organize into a connected swarm (Flying Ad Hoc Networks– FANETs) to complete various challenging missions. As the primary building block of Internet-of-Drones (IoD), FANETs have an important role to play in governing the autonomous movement of drones and supporting drone-to-everything (D2X) communications. However, factors such as flying characteristics and the highly dynamic topology of FANETs compound the challenges of packet forwarding; thus, the focus of this article. Specifically, a stochastic packet forwarding algorithm (hereafter referred to as SPA) is proposed for FANETs, where the data packets can be efficiently transferred to the destination. In SPA, the packet sender evaluates each next hop forwarding candidate drone based on different network metrics, prior to selecting the next hop forwarding drone according to the forwarding probability. In addition, an analytical model is developed to evaluate the performance of SPA. Then, the link expiration time and link throughput are chosen as network metrics for network simulation experiments, where SPA is evaluated and compared with prior schemes (e.g, $DTN_{geo}$ and GeoUAVs). The performance of SPA is evaluated in a real-world testbed to complement the network simulation experiments. Findings from the evaluations demonstrate that SPA obtains better performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet delivery latency, the number of delivered data packets, average link lifetime, and bit error rate.

AB  - Vision‐based sensing, when utilized in conjunction with camera‐equipped unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has recently emerged as an effective sensing technique in a variety of civil engineering applications (e.g., construction monitoring, conditional assessment, and post‐disaster reconnaissance). However, the use of these non‐intrusive sensing techniques for extracting the dynamic response of structures has been restricted due to the perspective and scale distortions or image misalignments caused by the movement of the UAV and its on‐board camera during flight operations. To overcome these limitations, a vision‐based analysis methodology is proposed in the present study for extracting the dynamic response of structures using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial videos. Importantly, geo‐referenced targets were strategically placed on the structures and the background (stationary) region to enhance the robustness and accuracy related to image feature detection. Image processing and photogrammetric techniques are adopted in the analysis procedures first to recover the camera motion using the world‐to‐image correspondences of the background (stationary) targets and subsequently to extract the dynamic structural response by reprojecting the image feature of the (moving) targets attached to the structures to the world coordinates. The displacement tracking results are validated using the responses of two full‐scale test structures measured by analog displacement sensors during a sequence of shake table tests. The high level of precision (less than 3 mm root‐mean‐square errors) of the vision‐based structural displacement results demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed UAV displacement tracking methodology. Additionally, the limitations and potential solutions associated with the proposed methodology for monitoring the dynamic responses of real structures are discussed.

AB  - We propose a collaborative planning and control algorithm to enhance cooperation for composite teams of autonomous robots in dynamic environments. Composite robot teams are groups of agents that perform different tasks according to their respective capabilities in order to accomplish an overarching mission. Examples of such teams include groups of perception agents (can only sense) and action agents (can only manipulate) working together to perform disaster response tasks. Coordinating robots in a composite team is a challenging problem due to the heterogeneity in the robots’ characteristics and their tasks. Here, we propose a coordination framework for composite robot teams. The proposed framework consists of two hierarchical modules: First, A multiagent state-action-reward-time-state-action algorithm in multiagent partially observable semi-Markov decision process as the high-level decision-making module to enable perception agents to learn to surveil in an environment with an unknown number of dynamic targets and second, a low-level coordinated control and planning module that ensures probabilistically guaranteed support for action agents. Simulation and physical robot implementations of our algorithms on a multiagent robot testbed demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of our coordination framework by reducing the overall operation times in a benchmark wildfire-fighting case study.

AB  - This paper introduces HIRO-NET, an Heterogeneous Intelligent Robotic Network. HIRO-NET is an emergency infrastructure-less network tailored to address the problem of providing connectivity in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, where no cellular or wide area network is operational and no Internet access is available. HIRO-NET establishes a two-tier wireless mesh network where the Lower Tier connects nearby survivors in a self-organized mesh via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the Upper Tier creates long-range VHF links between autonomous robots exploring the disaster stricken area. HIRO-NET's main goal is to enable users in the disaster area to exchange text messages to share critical information and request help from first responders. The mesh network discovery problem is analyzed and a network protocol specifically designed to facilitate the exploration process is presented. We show how HIRO-NET robots successfully discover, bridge and interconnect local mesh networks. Results show that the Lower Tier always reaches network convergence and the Upper Tier can virtually extend HIRO-NET functionalities to the range of a small metropolitan area. In the event of an Internet connection still being available to some user, HIRO-NET is able to opportunistically share and provide access to low data-rate services to the whole network.

AB  - Mobile ad hoc network is a network composed of mobile terminals without infrastructure. Due to its fast-networking ability, it is widely used in smart cities, car networking, military, agriculture, medicine, and other fields. Routing technology is a key technology in the field of MANET (mobile ad hoc network). The energy consumption is optimized through the technical network simulator NS-3, and the nodes in the MANET routing protocol can accurately simulate the problem, thereby optimizing the MAC layer of important research tools. This article combines the advantages of the lithium-ion (lithium) battery model. Compared with the KiBaM battery model, the effective charge in the KiBaM model simulates the output voltage well, which can reflect the battery capacity effect rate and the recovery effect of the lithium-ion-KiBaM battery model. The model can respond to the characteristics of the output voltage as the society gets lower and lower. In order to solve the problem that the analytic solution of differential equations cannot be obtained in the model, a numerical solution of the optimization algorithm is proposed based on the implicit Runge–Kutta method. The MAC layer energy consumption and routing protocol optimization algorithm proposed in this paper can be applied well in various fields.

This paper introduces a novel bio-inspired immunized-adaptive technique applied to a multi-agent consensus control problem in the presence of bounded time-varying disturbances and cyber- physical communication attacks. Analyses of the capabilities of the controller to reject these disturbances, and a comparison against an adversarial deep-reinforcement learning algorithm is presented. Numerical simulations successfully demonstrate the potential of both bio-inspired techniques to overcome bounded disturbances within a distributed control consensus.

AB  - Edge computing promotes the execution of complex computational processes without the cloud, i.e., on top of the heterogeneous, articulated, and possibly mobile systems composed of IoT and edge devices. Such a pervasive smart fabric augments our environment with computing and networking capabilities. This leads to a complex and dynamic ecosystem of devices that should not only exhibit individual intelligence but also collective intelligence—the ability to take group decisions or process knowledge among autonomous units of a distributed environment. Self-adaptation and self-organisation mechanisms are also typically required to ensure continuous and inherent toleration of changes of various kinds, to distribution of devices, energy available, computational load, as well as faults. To achieve this behaviour in a massively distributed setting like edge computing demands, we seek for identifying proper abstractions, and engineering tools therefore, to smoothly capture collective behaviour, adaptivity, and dynamic injection and execution of concurrent distributed activities. Accordingly, we elaborate on a notion of “aggregate process” as a concurrent collective computation whose execution and interactions are sustained by a dynamic team of devices, whose spatial region can opportunistically vary over time. We ground this notion by extending the aggregate computing model and toolchain with new constructs to instantiate aggregate processes and regulate key aspects of their lifecycle. By virtue of an open-source implementation in the ScaFi framework, we show basic programming examples as well as case studies of edge computing, evaluated by simulation in realistic settings.

AB  - Human multi-robot system (MRS) collaboration is demonstrating potentials in wide application scenarios due to the integration of human cognitive skills and a robot team’s powerful capability introduced by its multi-member structure. However, due to limited human cognitive capability, a human cannot simultaneously monitor multiple robots and identify the abnormal ones, largely limiting the efficiency of the human-MRS collaboration. There is an urgent need to proactively reduce unnecessary human engagements and further reduce human cognitive loads. Human trust in human MRS collaboration reveals human expectations on robot performance. Based on trust estimation, the work between a human and MRS will be reallocated that an MRS will self-monitor and only request human guidance in critical situations. Inspired by that, a novel Synthesized Trust Learning (STL) method was developed to model human trust in the collaboration. STL explores two aspects of human trust (trust level and trust preference), meanwhile accelerates the convergence speed by integrating active learning to reduce human workload. To validate the effectiveness of the method, tasks "searching victims in the context of city rescue" were designed in an open-world simulation environment, and a user study with 10 volunteers was conducted to generate real human trust feedback. The results showed that by maximally utilizing human feedback, the STL achieved higher accuracy in trust modeling with a few human feedback, effectively reducing human interventions needed for modeling an accurate trust, therefore reducing human cognitive load in the collaboration.

AB  - Today, the creation of intelligent sensors became possible due to the development of the hardware base, the use of small boards, where the processor, memory, and network interfaces can be placed. Examples of such cards can be Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and others. These devices can be used to connect various sensors to them depending on the tasks. Today, there are many protocols for the exchange of messages between such sender devices, which ultimately leads to the creation of distributed networks with distributed functionality. Such systems can be decision-making and are like swarm intelligence, where each device performs its functions, but together they are a single system. This study will examine the information security issues of such systems. An analysis of threats and vulnerabilities for intelligent sensor systems was carried out. Demonstrated an attack on the secure ZigBee protocol, which is often used to create a network between smart sensors. The use of lightweight cryptography to minimize risks is proposed.

AB  - Navigation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to reach a desired waypoint in global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environments is considered. The UAV is assumed to have an unknown initial state and the environment is assumed to possess multiple terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs) transmitters with unknown states and one anchor SOP whose states are known. The UAV makes pseudorange measurements to all SOPs to estimate its own states simultaneously with the states of the unknown SOPs. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective motion planning (MOMP) strategy, which guarantees the UAV gets to within a user-specified distance of the waypoint with a user-specified confidence. The MOMP strategy balances two objectives: (i) navigating to the waypoint and (ii) reducing UAVs position estimate uncertainty. It is demonstrated that in such an environment, formulating the waypoint navigation problem in a so-called naive fashion by heading directly to the waypoint results in failing to reach the waypoint due to poor estimability of the environment. In contrast, the MOMP strategy guarantees (in a probabilistic sense) reaching the waypoint. Simulation and experimental results are presented showing that the MOMP strategy achieves the desired objective while the naive strategy fails to do so.

AB  - This paper considers distributed estimation methods to enable the formation of Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles (UAVs) that track a moving target. The UAVs (or agents) are equipped with communication devices to receive a beacon signal from the target and share information with neighboring UAVs. The shared information includes the time-of-arrival (TOA) of the beacon signal from the target and estimates on the target's location. Every UAV processes the received information from the neighbors using a single-time-scale distributed estimation protocol. This differs from multi-time-scale protocols that require (i) many consensus iterations on a-priori estimates, (ii) fast communication among agents (in general, much faster than the sampling rate of the target dynamics), and thus, more-costly communication equipment and processing units. Further, our approach outperforms most single-time-scale methods in terms of observability assumption as these methods assume that the target is observable via the measurement data received from neighboring UAVs (referred to as local-observability). This requires more communications among the sensors. In contrast, our approach is only based on global-observability assumption, and thus, requires less networking (only strong-connectivity) and communication traffic along with less computational load by data-processing once at the same time-scale of sampling target dynamics. We consider modified time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements with a constant output matrix for the linearized model. UAVs make a pre-specified formation, and by estimating the target's location via these measurements, move along with the target.

AB  - Spatial spectrum estimation, also known as direction of arrival (DOA) detection, is a popular issue in many fields, including remote sensing, radar, communication, sonar, seismic exploration, radio astronomy, and biomedical engineering. MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) and Estimation Signal Parameter via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT), which are well-known for their high-resolution capability for detecting DOA, are two examples of an eigen-subspace algorithm. However, missed detection and estimation accuracy reduction often occur due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and snapshot deficiency (small time-domain samples of the observed signal), especially for sources with different SNRs. To avoid the above problems, in this study, we develop a DOA detection approach through signal subspace reconstruction using Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). In the developed scheme, according to received data, a noise subspace is established through performing an eigen-decomposition operation on a sampling covariance matrix. Then, a collection of angles randomly selected from the observation space are used to build a potential signal subspace on the basis of the steering matrix of the array. Afterwards, making use of the fact that the signal space is orthogonal to the noise subspace, a cost function, which contains the desired DOA information, is designed. Thus, the problem of capturing the DOA information can be transformed into the optimization of the already constructed cost function. In this respect, the DOA finding of multiple signal sources—that is, the multi-objective optimization problem—can be regarded as a single objective optimization problem, which can effectively reduce the probability of missed detection of the signals. Subsequently, the QPSO is employed to determine an optimal signal subspace by minimizing the orthogonality error so as to obtain the DOA. Ultimately, the performance of DOA detection is improved. An explicit analysis and derivation of the developed scheme are provided. The results of computer simulation show that the proposed scheme has superior estimation performance when detecting signals with very different SNR levels and small snapshots.

AB  - A resilient multi-vehicle system cooperatively performs tasks by exchanging information, detecting, and removing cyber attacks that have the intent of hijacking or diminishing performance of the entire system. In this paper, we propose a framework to: i) detect and isolate misbehaving vehicles in the network, and ii) securely encrypt information among the network to alert and attract nearby vehicles toward points of interest in the environment without explicitly broadcasting safety-critical information. To accomplish these goals, we lever-age a decentralized virtual spring-damper mesh physics model for formation control on each vehicle. To discover inconsistent behavior of any vehicle in the network, we consider an approach that monitors for changes in sign behavior of an inter-vehicle residual that does not match with an expectation. Similarly, to disguise important information and trigger vehicles to switch to different behaviors, we leverage side-channel information on the state of the vehicles and characterize a hidden spring-damper signature model detectable by neighbor vehicles. Our framework is demonstrated in simulation and experiments on formations of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in the presence of malicious man-in-the-middle communication attacks.

AB  - Future mobile communication networks need Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as Base Stations (UAVasBSs) with the fast-moving and long-term hovering capabilities to guarantee consistent network performance. UAVasBSs help 5G/B5G mobile communication systems to rapidly recover from emergency situations and handle the instant traffic of the flash crowd. In this context, multiple UAVs might form a flying ad-hoc network to establish a flying access network to enhance the network connectivity and service quality. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal number and locations of UAVasBSs in a fast and efficient way to cover the target area to provide temporary yet reliable cellular connectivity. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and network data analysis are key tools to fulfill the above issues. In this article, we propose a smart UAVasBS placement (SUAP) mechanism to improve the mobile network operations in flash crowd and emergency situations. We have modeled such an UAVasBS placement task as an optimization problem to obtain required network connectivity and system performance, and resolved it with a genetic algorithm using the network context information. Simulation results show that our proposal could cover 90% of mobile users, and it provides nearly 90% packet delivery ratio for users with a fast convergence rate.

AB  - Due to the rapid paradigm shift in IoT networks from wired and centralized to flexible wireless and decentralized networks, building effective and reliable distributed consensus mechanisms over wireless is becoming essential. Especially, since the performance of consensus over communication endpoints in a large-scale wireless network is limited by their communication capability, it requires a careful co-design of communication and consensus to attain a fast and scalable distributed wireless consensus mechanism with high resiliency against faulty nodes. Within this context, this paper addresses such problem by designing two wireless consensus mechanisms that well-suit in large-scale wireless networks. On the one hand, as a reinterpretation of the conventional referendum consensus (RC) in a large-scale wireless network, gossip-broadcasting based referendum consensus (GB-RC) is proposed. On the other hand, to overcome the scalability issue of the GB-RC, cooperative-broadcast based electoral-college consensus (CB-EC) is proposed. By mathematically analyzing the performance of both of the consensus mechanisms, in terms of consensus latency and resiliency against the faulty nodes, we show that the GB-RC outperforms the conventional RC, while the CB-EC significantly reduces the consensus latency compromising the stochastic resiliency. We further evaluate their performance numerically to show their effectiveness and feasibility under realistic large-scale wireless environments.

AB  - Change detection (CD) is an important vision task for autonomous landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) on water. High-density photoreceptors and lateral inhibition mechanisms have inspired a novel biologic computational method based on structure and properties in eagle eyes as proposed for change detection. We call this method “STabCD,” which ensures spatiotemporal distribution consistency to achieve foreground acquisition, noise reduction, and background adaptability. Therefore, our proposed model responds strongly to object information and suppresses noise and wave textures. Then, we present a cloning method to simulate water scenes and collect a new synthetic dataset (called “Synthetic Boat Sequence”) for UAV vision research. Besides, we utilize synthetic datasets and corresponding real datasets to conduct change detection experiments. The experimental results indicate that: 1) the STabCD model achieves the best results in real or synthetic water landing scenes; and 2) change detection models for UAV can be quantitatively analyzed and tested under challenging synthetic scenarios.

AB  - As one of today's popular research field, mobile robots, are widely used in entertainment, search and rescue, health, military, agriculture and many other fields with the advantages of technological developments. Object detection is one of the methods used for mobile robots to gather and report information about its environment during those tasks. With the ability to detect and classify objects, a robot can determine the type and number of objects around it and use this knowledge in its movement and path planning or reporting the objects with the desired features. Considering the dimensions of mobile robots and weight constraints of flying robots, the use of these algorithms is more limited. While the size and weight of mobile devices should be kept relatively small, successful object classification algorithms require processors with high computational power. In this study, to be able to use object detection information for mapping and path planning object detection and classification methods were examined, and for the usage in low weight and low energy consuming platforms through developer boards, detection algorithms were compared to each other.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as aerial base stations, is a promising solution for providing end-to-end wireless communications to ground users, thanks to its positioning, flexibility, and autonomy. However, to provide end-to-end wireless communication services, all UAVs must ensure a reliable multi-UAV network topology, even when one or more UAVs are knocked off the network due to hardware/software faults, unreliable wireless connections, etc. Hence, how to design a reliable Multi-UAV network with a minimum number of UAVs becomes a key design issue, which is largely unaddressed in the literature. In this paper, we propose exploring biological robustness to design a reliable MuLtI-UAV NetworK, termed, bio-LINK, which is resilient against the UAV node failures and thus, ensures reliable end-to-end communication services to ground users. We first formulate the above bio-LINK problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problem and show it is NP-Hard. Next, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic that employs an iterative UAV positioning inspired by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) random sampling approach. Our extensive simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms three baseline algorithms in terms of several considered robustness metrics (e.g., motif count, network efficiency, etc.) and ground user coverage, notwithstanding the random and targeted failure of UAV nodes. When compared with a baseline algorithm with the same number of UAVs, the proposed algorithm retains the motif count by 5–6 folds and improves network efficiency by 39 - 95% and ground user coverage by 2-18%.

AB  - A cyber-physical system (CPS) is the integration of a physical system into the real world and control applications in a computing system, interacting through a communications network. Network technology connecting physical systems and computing systems enables the simultaneous control of many physical systems and provides intelligent applications for them. However, enhancing connectivity leads to extended attack vectors in which attackers can trespass on the network and launch cyber-physical attacks, remotely disrupting the CPS. Therefore, extensive studies into cyber-physical security are being conducted in various domains, such as physical, network, and computing systems. Moreover, large-scale and complex CPSs make it difficult to analyze and detect cyber-physical attacks, and thus, machine learning (ML) techniques have recently been adopted for cyber-physical security. In this survey, we provide an extensive review of the threats and ML-based security designs for CPSs. First, we present a CPS structure that classifies the functions of the CPS into three layers: the physical system, the network, and software applications. Then, we discuss the taxonomy of cyber-physical attacks on each layer, and in particular, we analyze attacks based on the dynamics of the physical system. We review existing studies on detecting cyber-physical attacks with various ML techniques from the perspectives of the physical system, the network, and the computing system. Furthermore, we discuss future research directions for ML-based cyber-physical security research in the context of real-time constraints, resiliency, and dataset generation to learn about the possible attacks.

AB  - Today, legacy PMRs continue to be the only group of tested, verified and certified technologies for the Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) sector. For the fifth generation (5G) to follow suit, substantial hands-on experimentation with functional, architectural and deployment aspects is required, and further test trials need to take place in order to inform and enable future verification and certification procedures for 5G to become a proven PPDR technology. This paper studies 5G PPDR experimentation associated with novel virtualized and cloud-native 5G technologies, architectures and deployment options, as well as feasibility studies and field performance and verifications trials involving vertical-specific 5G infrastructures and applications. Key enabling technologies, such as massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO), device-to-device (D2D), network slicing and multi-access edge computing (MEC) are discussed and 5G PPDR architecture and deployment options are investigated. A dedicated 5G PPDR experimentation facility is presented, and a case study of hands-on experimentation is provided. Two distinct scenarios are discussed, i.e., emergency augmentation of the terrestrial 5G PPDR network with rapidly deployable on-site capacities in the area of a public safety incident, and availability and reliability of decision-support PPDR applications on the field. Experience with the deployment and verification insights are accompanied by the results of quality of service (QoS) and non-functional key performance indicators (KPI) assessment that were exhibited during the experiment. The experimentation outcomes confirm the ability of the facility to support emulated laboratory experimentation specifically designed to tackle 5G challenges for this particular vertical as well as field studies recreating realistic public safety operations.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has gained popularity with the growth and prospects of smart networks. It is intended to exploit the network edges, which enables smart service and assessment for IoT. Moreover, this exploitation not only improves the user experiences but also provides service resiliencies at any catastrophe. The IoT appliances deploy distributed structure and proximity of end-users to offer quicker responses and improved quality of service (QoS). Nevertheless, security is mainly considered to resist the susceptibility of attacks. This work aims to introduce a novel secure routing model by carrying out optimal path selection and encryption. Initially, optimal link-state multipath routing takes place, where optimal paths or nodes are chosen for secure transmission. For optimal path selection destination and source, a Crossover Mutated Marriage in Honey Bee (CM-MH) algorithm is developed and proposed in this work. Next, encryption takes place that ensures secure transmission. In this research, an Improved Blowfish algorithm (IBFA) is proposed for secured authentication. Finally, the updates are monitored. At last, the supremacy of the developed approach is examined via evaluation over numerous existing techniques.

AB  - In order to meet mobile users’ unprecedented communication demands and the goal of global seamless communication, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) have attracted lots of attention in recent years. Existing works related on air segment mainly discussed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), airships and balloons near the space. However, they neglected many other valuable resources, such like civil aircrafts (CAs). Moreover, communication problems for remote areas and emergency scenarios (such as disasters and hot-spot areas) have not been solved thoroughly. Motivated by these facts, we introduce CAs to enhance the current SAGIN and present a novel architecture called “civil aircrafts augmented space-airground integrated vehicular networks” (CAA-SAGIVN). The proposed network architecture makes breakthrough in three main aspects: a normal network architecture, collaboration with multiple sky access platforms (SAPs), and service-oriented fair allocation. Although CAA-SAGIVN can bring out many benefits, it also faces more challenges due to its high mobility and crosslayer characteristics. Therefore, we provide an exhaustive review of state-of-the-art works on modeling, mobility management, solutions of service-oriented allocation in SAGIN. On the basis of the preliminary investigation and discussion, some open issues are identified as possible future research directions.

AB  - Multi-agent navigation systems present opportunities for many applications due to their agility and cooperation. In any multi-agent navigation system, it is critical that actual inter-agent collisions are strictly prevented. In this paper, we present a solution for the 2-D multi-agent navigation problem with collision avoidance. Our solution to this problem is based on a novel extension to Gauss's Principle of Least Constraint (GPLC) in which a fixed set of strict equality constraints are replaced by time-varying sets of active inequality constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance that extends GPLC with dynamic incorporation and stabilization of active inequality constraints and with actuator delay and saturation. Herein, the dynamics of a collision-free multi-agent system satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Active inequality constraints enforce collision avoidance, leader following and agglomeration behaviors, and they are stabilized using Baumgarte's error stabilization approach. We show that in dense configurations the positional arrangement of the agents can lead to linearly dependent constraints, and we propose specialized solutions involvin

AB  - Key pre-distribution schemes are promising lightweight solutions to be placed as the cornerstone of key management systems in multi-hop wireless networks. The intermediate decryption-encryption problem, however, is considered as the security threat of such schemes. Multi-path algorithms have been proposed to face such a shortcoming. Alas, these solutions are vulnerable against the node capture attack, where the attacker compromises a fraction of network nodes. In this paper, we propose BlocKP, a Blockchain-based solution to increase the resistance of the network against the node capture attack. BlocKP utilizes disjoint key-paths for a key exchange process, where the keying materials form a block at the source-side. Each key-path step generates the next block of the Blockchain until the keying materials reach the destination. BlocKP is a general framework applicable to any key pre-distribution schemes. We propose BlocKP in two versions BlocKP-I and BlocKP-II, where the latter enhance the resistance of BlocKP-I using erasure codes at the cost of negligible control traffic. We analytically show that BlocKP improves the resistance of the network against the node capture attack to almost perfect resistance, using just a small number of paths. We evaluate our solution by performing extensive simulations, considering three baseline key pre-distribution schemes, including probabilistic asymmetric key pre-distribution (PAKP), strong Steiner trade (SST), and unital key pre-distribution (UKP). We equipped these schemes with a compatible multi-path algorithm to offer end-to-end security. Results show that BlocKP improves the throughput up to 5% and decreases the flow completion time into 20% compared to baseline schemes. It has comparable routing traffic, latency, and throughput with augmented solutions but up to 60% improvement in the resistance against the node capture attack.

AB  - Edge computing brings down storage, computation, and communication services from the cloud server to the network edge, resulting in low latency and high availability. The Internet of things (IoT) devices are resource-constrained, unable to process compute-intensive tasks. The convergence of edge computing and IoT with computation offloading offers a feasible solution in terms of performance. Besides these, computation offload saves energy, reduces computation time, and extends the battery life of resource constrain IoT devices. However, edge computing faces the scalability problem, when IoT devices in large numbers approach edge for computation offloading requests. This research article presents a three-tier energy-efficient framework to address the scalability issue in edge computing. We introduced an energy-efficient recursive clustering technique at the IoT layer that prioritizes the tasks based on weight. Each selected task with the highest weight value offloads to the edge server for execution. A lightweight client–server architecture affirms to reduce the computation offloading overhead. The proposed energy-efficient framework for IoT algorithm makes efficient computation offload decisions while considering energy and latency constraints. The energy-efficient framework minimizes the energy consumption of IoT devices, decreases computation time and computation overhead, and scales the edge server. Numerical results show that the proposed framework satisfies the quality of service requirements of both delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant applications by minimizing energy and increasing the lifetime of devices.

AB  - The wide-area damping controllers showed to be effective in improving the damping ratio of the low-frequency oscillation modes. This controller requires remotes signals sent by Phasor Measurement Units located in different positions of the power system and, then, these signals are highly susceptible to communication time delays, failures and cyber-attacks that may compromise controller performance. This paper presents a procedure based on particle swarm optimization to tune the parameters of the central controller. Considering a set of operating conditions, the proposed procedure will search the central controller parameters that maximize the damping ratio of all eigenvalues of the linear model. A strategy to deal with permanent communication channel failures and time delay uncertainties in a given interval will be included in the proposed model and procedure. Then, the resulting central controller will present robustness to multiple operation conditions of the power system, to time delay uncertainties and to permanent failure of the channels of the controller. The proposed procedure was carried out in the IEEE 68-bus system and the performance of the designed controller was evaluated by modal analysis and time-domain nonlinear simulation.

AB  - Resource management (RM) is a challenging task in a cloud computing environment where a large number of virtualized, heterogeneous, and distributed resources are hosted in the datacentres. The uncertainty, heterogeneity, and the dynamic nature of such resources affect the efficiency of provisioning, allocation, scheduling, and monitoring tasks of RM. The most existing RM techniques and strategies have insufficiency in handling such cloud resources dynamic behaviour. To resolve these limitations, there is a need for the design and development of intelligent and efficient autonomic RM techniques to ensure the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of cloud-based applications, satisfy the cloud user requirements, and avoid a Service-Level Agreement (SLA) violations. This paper presents a comprehensive review along with a taxonomy of the most recent existing autonomic and elastic RM techniques in a cloud environment. The taxonomy classifies the existing autonomic and elastic RM techniques into different categories based on their design, objective, function, and applications. Moreover, a comparison and qualitative analysis is provided to illustrate their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the open issues and challenges are highlighted to help researchers in finding significant future research options.

AB  - Task offloading decision making plays a key role in enabling mobile-edge computing (MEC) technologies in Internet of Things (IoT). However, it meets the significant challenges arising from the stochastic dynamics of task queueing in the application layer and coupled wireless interference in the physical layer in a distributed multiagent network without any centralized communication and computing coordination. In this article, we investigate the distributed task offloading optimization problem with consideration of the upper layer queueing dynamics and the lower-layer coupled wireless interference. We first propose a new optimization model that aims at maximizing the expected offloading rate of multiple agents by optimizing their offloading thresholds. Then, we transform the problem into a game-theoretic formulation, which further leads to the design of a distributed best-response (DBR) iterative optimization framework. The existence of Nash equilibrium strategies in the game-theoretic model has been analyzed. For the individual optimization of each agent’s threshold policy, we further propose a programming scheme by transforming a constrained threshold optimization into an unconstrained Lagrangian optimization (ULO). The individual ULO is integrated into the DBR framework to enable agents to cooperate and converge to a global optimum in a distributed manner. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the proposed method and demonstrate its significant advantage over other existing distributed methods. The numerical results also show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance to a centralized optimization method.

AB  - For several decades now, the construction industry is suffering from low productivity, especially in comparison to manufacturing industries which have succeeded to benefit from digitalization of their processes. Furthermore, scarceness of qualified workforce is expected in the near future. Construction automation is introduced as a solution to these challenges. The capabilities of construction robots are improving at an accelerated pace. They are starting to be used in non-laboratory contexts for automating processes ranging from infrastructure inspection to digital fabrication. One fundamental requirement of employing robots in construction is their autonomous positioning. Building information modelling (BIM) and geographic information system (GIS) are now a necessity for the construction projects. Integration between BIM and GIS provides holistic digital representation of the built environment that robots could potentially utilize for positioning purposes. Preceding this research, a number of reviews have been conducted on BIM–GIS integration, but none studied it from automation perspective. This research addresses this deficiency through a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art on BIM–GIS integration with the purpose of robot positioning and navigation on construction sites. Using software tools and “science-mapping” methods, 236 papers were explored. Trends, challenges, potentials, and deficiencies identified and mapped. Citation patterns of journal articles along with the analysis of studies; visualized and analyzed. Bibliometric analysis is followed by a thorough qualitative analysis of the articles identified by the systematic methodology indicating limitations of current studies such as vertical navigation, inaccuracy, dynamics of construction sites, indoor-outdoor navigation. Requirements for robot positioning using BIM–GIS integration are defined.

AB  - In this paper we study a generalized case of best-of-n model, which considers three kind of agents: zealots, individuals who remain stubborn and do not change their opinion; informed agents, individuals that can change their opinion, are able to assess the quality of the different options; and uninformed agents, individuals that can change their opinion but are not able to assess the quality of the different opinions. We study the consensus in different regimes: we vary the quality of the options, the percentage of zealots and the percentage of informed versus uninformed agents. We also consider two decision mechanisms: the voter and majority rule. We study this problem using numerical simulations and mathematical models, and we validate our findings on physical kilobot experiments. We find that (1) if the number of zealots for the lowest quality option is not too high, the decision-making process is driven toward the highest quality option; (2) this effect can be improved increasing the number of informed agents that can counteract the effect of adverse zealots; (3) when the two options have very similar qualities, in order to keep high consensus to the best quality it is necessary to have higher proportions of informed agents.

AB  - Aiming at the problem of slow convergence in the parallel calculation of patch area landscape art index, a parallel calculation method of patch area landscape art index based on land cover data was proposed. Firstly, patch type area index, patch connectivity index, patch number index, and fragmentation index were selected as patch area landscape art spatial staggered pattern indexes to conduct characteristic analysis and establish a 3D visual reconstruction model with actual colors. Then, the coordinate points of the landscape space staggered pattern are transformed into three-dimensional visual coordinate points to realize the reconstruction of landscape art space staggered pattern in patch area. The aerial landscape image of patch area is preprocessed and input into GPU to build a Gaussian difference pyramid model. The feature points of the patch area in the aerial landscape image are calculated by the parallel computing process, and the patch boundary in the aerial landscape image is determined. The landscape perimeter of the patch area was calculated according to the boundary. The experimental results show that the complete convergence time of the horizontal axis error and the vertical axis error is 2.13 s and 1.81 s, respectively, and the absolute error and relative error of the perimeter measurement are controlled below 0.60 m and 1.00%, respectively.

AB  - While network operators have already started deploying commercial 5th generation (5G) networks, existing cellular technologies may lack the level of reliability, availability, and responsiveness requested by future wireless applications. For this reason, the research community at large is already defining the most promising technologies that can enable 6th generation (6G) wireless systems. We have identified three critical innovations: (1) communications at Terahertz and optical frequencies for ultra-high-speed broadband access, (2) cell-less architectures to enable ubiquitous 3D coverage, and (3) intelligent networks to simplify the management of complex networks and reduce costs. In this chapter, after summarizing envisioned use cases and corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the 6G ecosystem, we will review the characteristics of these innovations and speculate about whether and how they will satisfy the most stringent 6G network demands in a holistic fashion, in view of the foreseen economic, social, technological, and environmental context of the 2030 era.

AB  - In this paper, we study the problem of wireless sensor network (WSN) maintenance using a team of physical autonomous mobile agents. The agents are deployed in the area of the WSN in such a way that would minimize the time it takes them to reach a failed sensor and repair it. The team must constantly optimize its collective deployment to account for occupied agents. The objective is to define the optimal deployment and task allocation strategy, that minimize the solution cost. The solution cost is a linear combination of the weighted sensors’ downtime, the agents’ traveling distance, and penalties incurred due to unrepaired sensors within a certain time limit. Our proposed solution algorithms are inspired by research in the field of computational geometry and the design of our algorithms is based on state of the art approximation algorithms for the classical problem of facility location. We empirically compare and analyze the performance of several proposed algorithms. The sensitivity of the algorithms’ performance to the following parameters is analyzed: agents to sensors ratio, sensors’ sparsity, frequency and distribution of failures, repair duration, repair capacity, and communication limitations. Our results demonstrate that: (i) cooperation enhances the team’s performance by orders of magnitude, (ii) k -Median based deployment algorithm provides up to 30% improvement in downtime, (iii) k -Center based deployment incurs 10% fewest penalties, and (iv) k -Centroid based deployment is most efficient in terms of minimizing the overall costs, with up to 21% lower cost than the next best algorithm.

AB  - Intelligent unmanned robotic systems have recently gained popularity due to their ability to potentially explore inaccessible and dynamically changing environments. In these environments, these vehicles might be subjected to unique types of disturbances that may lead to mission performance degradation. This paper describes the design, development and proof of concept of a novel adaptive control that combines concepts from model reference and feedback linearization and it is augmented via nonlinear bounded functions typical in immune system responses of living organisms. Proof of stability of the proposed control law using Circle Criterion is presented. Numerical hardware in the loop simulations along with actual implementation are performed using a gimbaled mini-free flyer vehicle that uses thrust vectoring control actuation. A set of performance index metrics are used to quantify and assess the performance of the adaptive control system which shows stabilizing capabilities in the presence of system disturbances and uncertainties.

AB  - Forests are the planet’s main CO2 filtering agent as well as important economical, environmental and social assets. Climate change is exerting an increased stress, resulting in a need for improved research methodologies to study their health, composition or evolution. Traditionally, information about forests has been collected using expensive and work-intensive field inventories, but in recent years unoccupied autonomous vehicles (UAVs) have become very popular as they represent a simple and inexpensive way to gather high resolution data of large forested areas. In addition to this trend, deep learning (DL) has also been gaining much attention in the field of forestry as a way to include the knowledge of forestry experts into automatic software pipelines tackling problems such as tree detection or tree health/species classification. Among the many sensors that UAVs can carry, RGB cameras are fast, cost-effective and allow for straightforward data interpretation. This has resulted in a large increase in the amount of UAV-acquired RGB data available for forest studies. In this review, we focus on studies that use DL and RGB images gathered by UAVs to solve practical forestry research problems. We summarize the existing studies, provide a detailed analysis of their strengths paired with a critical assessment on common methodological problems and include other information, such as available public data and code resources that we believe can be useful for researchers that want to start working in this area. We structure our discussion using three main families of forestry problems: (1) individual Tree Detection, (2) tree Species Classification, and (3) forest Anomaly Detection (forest fires and insect Infestation).

AB  - The growth of a global digital economy has enabled rapid communication, instantaneous movement of funds, and availability of vast amounts of information. With this come challenges such as the vulnerability of digitalized sociotechnological systems (STSs) to destructive events (earthquakes, disease events, terrorist attacks). Similar issues arise for disruptions to complex linked natural and social systems (from changing climates, evolving urban environments, etc.). This book explores new approaches to the resilience of sociotechnological and natural-social systems in a digital world of big data, extraordinary computing capacity, and rapidly developing methods of Artificial Intelligence. Most of the book’s papers were presented at the Workshop on Big Data and Systems Analysis held at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria in February, 2020. Their authors are associated with the Task Group “Advanced mathematical tools for data-driven applied systems analysis” created and sponsored by CODATA in November, 2018. The world-wide COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the vulnerability of our healthcare systems, supply chains, and social infrastructure, and confronts our notions of what makes a system resilient. We have found that use of AI tools can lead to problems when unexpected events occur. On the other hand, the vast amounts of data available from sensors, satellite images, social media, etc. can also be used to make modern systems more resilient. Papers in the book explore disruptions of complex networks and algorithms that minimize departure from a previous state after a disruption; introduce a multigrammatical framework for the technological and resource bases of today’s large-scale industrial systems and the transformations resulting from disruptive events; and explain how robotics can enhance pre-emptive measures or post-disaster responses to increase resiliency. Other papers explore current directions in data processing and handling and principles of FAIRness in data; how the availability of large amounts of data can aid in the development of resilient STSs and challenges to overcome in doing so. The book also addresses interactions between humans and built environments, focusing on how AI can inform today’s smart and connected buildings and make them resilient, and how AI tools can increase resilience to misinformation and its dissemination.

AB  - Vehicular edge computing (VEC), being a novel computing paradigm, promises to provide divergent vehicular edge services, both functional (e.g., charging route prediction, emergency messages, etc.) and infotainment (e.g. video gaming applications, featured movie series, etc.), at the network edge while satisfying application-specific QoS requirements. Vehicles usually send these service requests to nearest roadside units (RSUs), which contain mobile edge servers, according to the functional requirements or the vehicle owner preferences. However, the VEC server’s virtual resources may fall short compared to the unbounded amount of real-time service requests (infotainment/functional) during rush hours. This limitation entails VEC servers to fail to meet the stringent latency requirements which may create unwanted malfunction event during driving in the requested vehicles (if functional/critical service requests are delayed in processing). Moreover, the VEC environment’s intrinsic properties, i.e. mobility, application-specific distinct latency requirements, traffic congestion, and uncertain task arrival rate, make the VEC task scheduling problem a non-trivial one. In this paper, we propose an extreme reinforcement learning (ERL) based context-aware VEC task scheduler that can make online adaptive scheduling decisions to meet the application-specific latency requirements for both types of tasks (i.e. functional and infotainment). The scheduler can make scheduling decisions directly from its experience without prior knowledge or the VEC environment model. Finally, we present extensive simulation results to confirm the efficacy of the proposed scheduler. Results show that the VEC server can achieve successful (by meeting QoS requirements) task completion rate of above 96% for different task arrival rates (ranging from 10 to 50 arrival/s) using the proposed scheduler. In the simulation, we also analyze the scheduling algorithm’s scalability in response to the vertical expansion of the VEC server. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our proposed method with two baseline methods.

AB  - We study the problem of Resilient Service Provisioning for Edge computing (RSPE), i.e., how to determine a service placement strategy to maximize the expected overall utility by service provisioning, in the presence of uncertain service failures. RSPE is extremely challenging to tackle, because the explicit expression of its objective function is difficult to obtain, and it is a resilient max-min problem subject to knapsack constraints, which is unexplored so far and cannot be addressed by existing resilient optimization techniques. We first explore the potential properties of the implicit objective function, and reveal that it is monotone submodular under certain conditions. We further prove that the knapsack constraints form a q-independence system constraint, where q>0 is a constant related to the constraints. We propose two novel solutions for the general RSPE and homogeneous case, respectively. Firstly, for the general problem, we propose a “two-step greedy” algorithm achieving constant approximation ratio within polynomial time. Secondly, for the homogeneous case where one of the knapsack constraints reduces to a matroid constraint, we propose an improved “first-greedy-then-local search” polynomial time algorithm achieving better approximation ratio than the previous one. Both extensive simulations and field experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

AB  - Precision Agriculture (PA) is a management strategy that utilizes communication and information technology for farm management. It is a key to improve productivity by using the best agricultural practices and optimal usage of resources. Agriculture faces diverse challenges due to soil degradation, climate variation, and increasing costs. To unfold these challenges, PA uses Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) and exploits acquisition, communication, and processing of the data as basic enabling technologies to amplify the crop yield. Also, many other multidisciplinary technologies are supporting PA in finding the most novel use cases for PA. The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed PA at almost every level. The fog/edge paradigm is mitigating many challenges such as network bandwidth and security by bringing computation closer to the deployed network. At the same time, Software Defined Networks (SDN) brings flexibility, big data assists in handling data, and nanotechnology plays a crucial part in driving the innovation in PA. This paper delves into ways these technologies are transforming PA in respective tracks, exhibiting the significance of integrating multidisciplinary approaches towards the future of PA. In addition to a comprehensive survey, this paper proposes a multidisciplinary architecture: AgriFusion, for efficient and cost-effective agriculture solutions. A list of industrial solutions for different aspects of farm management and their underlying focused technology have been highlighted. This can help to align research and industrial goals for PA. Furthermore, this paper defines a step approach to describe the performance dichotomy between resource availability and objectives for PA. In addition, solution architecture is proposed for designing Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in PA. In the end, some open research issues in implementing PA and respective future scopes have been presented.

AB  - Distributed generation (DG) is one of the essential segments of the arising microgrid idea that empowers sustainable power integration in a distribution network. In DG unit activity, inverters assume an indispensable part in interfacing energy sources with the grid utility. Interfacing can effectively be refined by working inverters with viable control strategies. These controllers have an important role in microgrids to improve system performance, stability, resilience and reliability. This paper reviews different control techniques that can use either isolated or grid connected mode irrespective of AC/DC microgrid. In addition, the specific characteristics of different control strategies are summarized to distinguish from distribution network control. Moreover, various control approaches including centralized, decentralized and distributed controls are compared according to their relative advantages and disadvantages. It also focused the features of controllers along with self-healing control. This review paper will be a good base for researchers working in microgrids and for the industry to execute the research work in real time.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to bring new opportunities for improving several services for the Society, from transportation to agriculture, from smart cities to fleet management. In this framework, massive connectivity represents one of the key issues. This is especially relevant when IoT systems are expected to cover a large geographical area or a region not reached by terrestrial network connections. In such scenarios, the usage of satellites might represent a viable solution for providing wide area coverage and connectivity in a flexible and affordable manner. Our paper presents a survey on current solutions for the deployment of IoT services in remote/rural areas by exploiting satellites. Several architectures and technical solutions are analyzed, underlining their features and limitations, and real test cases are presented. It has been highlighted that low-orbit satellites offer an efficient solution to support long-range IoT services, with a good trade-off in terms of coverage and latency. Moreover, open issues, new challenges, and innovative technologies have been focused, carefully considering the perimeter that current IoT standardization framework will impose to the practical implementation of future satellite based IoT systems.

AB  - The world is currently undergoing water scarcity problems, even if it seems to be the most abundant resource on earth. However, the freshwater account is really in small amounts, while agriculture production consumes 70% of the majority of water withdrawals than any other source. Therefore, in order to preserve it, the irrigation operation has to be optimized by controlling efficiently the water used for irrigation. For that purpose, several technologies can be applied, such as the internet of things (IoT) technology which can perform as decision support in the irrigation process. The precise irrigation systems based on IoT involve several intricacies such as huge amounts of data and integration of large system components, which makes it difficult to be optimized analytically or with deterministic methods. For this reason, it was necessary to develop stochastic multi-objective optimization methods such as the evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which can solve complicated problems with a large number of parameters in relation. The EAs may be of relevant use except that they introduce processing time constraints. In this article, we aim at making a state of the art about the use of EAs combined with IoT and applied to precise irrigation. We will focus particularly on their uses classifications as well as the manner in which they have been implemented to reduce their computing times in distributed computing architectures, particularly those using the cloud, as well as in hardware accelerators forms.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are increasingly more complex and integrated into our everyday lives forming the basis of smart infrastructures, products, and services. Consequently, there is a greater need for their ability to perform their required functions under expected and unexpected adverse events. Moreover, the multitude of threats and their rapid evolution pushes the development of approaches that go beyond pure technical reliability, rather encompassing multi-dimensional performance of a socio-technical system. These dimensions call for the notion of resilience, to be used as a staging area for modelling system performance. While a large number of documents deal with this kind of problem for systems including CPSs, a comprehensive review on the topic is still lacking. The scope of this paper is to survey available literature for understanding to which extent CPSs contribute to system resilience, and to synthetize the approaches developed in this domain. More than 500 documents were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review technique. This survey identifies main models and methods categorizing them on the basis of the hazards of interest and their effects on security, privacy, safety and business continuity. It also summarizes main conceptual frameworks and metrics used to assess and compare the resilience capabilities of a system including also CPSs. This cross-domain survey highlights the dominant techno-centric unit of analysis for available literature, still highlighting emerging trends towards more systemic representations of system threats, even socio-technically oriented, and respective modern investigation approaches.

AB  - Industry and related work and workplaces are constantly changing as a result of the implementation of new technologies, substances and work processes, changes in the composition of the workforce and the labor market, and new forms of employment and work organization. The implementation of new technologies represents certain ambivalence. Next to the positive impact on workers’ health, new risks and challenges can arise in the area of process and occupational safety and health of people at work. On these bases, it follows the need for predicting and handling the new risks, in order to ensure safe and healthy workplaces in the future. The aim of most forecasting studies is not only to identify new emerging risks, but also to foresee changes that could affect occupational safety and health. However, a number of questions still require proper investigation, i.e., “What impact do new emerging risks have on tertiary education in the area of Safety engineering? Has tertiary education already reacted to progress in science and research and does it have these innovations in its syllabus? How are tertiary graduates prepared for the real world of new technologies?” This paper represents a first attempt in the literature to provide answers to the raised questions, by a survey approach involving academics, Health Safety and Environment (HSE) industrial experts and university students in the Czech Republic. Even if statistical evaluation is limited to a single Country and to a small sample size, the obtained results allow suggesting practical recommendations that can contribute to ensuring new challenges in the area of education by addressing relevant culture issues needed to support new workplace realities according to the newly defined Safety 4.0.

AB  - Software Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a programmable approach for provisioning and managing network resources by defining a clear separation between the control and data forwarding planes. Nowadays SDN has gained significant attention in the military domain. Its use in the battlefield communication facilitates the end-to-end interactions and assists the exploitation of edge computing resources for processing data in the proximity. However, there are still various challenges related to the security and interoperability among several heterogeneous, dynamic, intermittent, and data packet technologies like multi-bearer network (MBN) that need to be addressed to leverage the benefits of SDN in tactical environments. In this chapter, we explicitly analyse these challenges and review the current research initiatives in SDN-enabled tactical networks. We also present a taxonomy on SDN-based tactical network orchestration according to the identified challenges and map the existing works to the taxonomy aiming at determining the research gaps and suggesting future directions.

AB  - The adoption of hybridized energy storage systems (HESSs) in standalone photovoltaic (PV) systems instead of single battery ESSs offers featured capabilities of high power/energy densities and extended lifespans to supply power through controllable power converters using robust controllers. This paper examines the HESS control subjected to pulsed power balance changes through splitting frequency parts of load requirements among battery and supercapacitor. The filtering-based frequency decoupling method ensures sharing control of HESS currents using a dual-loop structure with high control dynamic to track battery currents considering Bus voltage abnormalities, and a hysteresis current controller (HCC) to command supercapacitor currents using battery current setpoints. Three settings are used to assess the superior performance of the HESS: combining Proportional-Integral (PI) with Super-twisting sliding mode (STSMC) controllers in dual-loop control structures, time-constants, and current bandwidths of the HCC. Upon competitive findings, the optimal settings approve minimum Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) and Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) of bus voltage, HESS currents, power deficits, besides load-meeting rates. The STSMC outperforms due to its super-spiral curve offering rapid convergence and reduced chattering that influences the stability in conventional SM. Then, less stressed and smooth behavior of the HESS, stable bus voltage, smooth power flowing, and high load sharing efficiency are achieved.

AB  - The thriving of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is driving the further evolution of wireless networks. It has been envisioned that 6G will be transformative and will revolutionize the evolution of wireless from “connected things” to “connected intelligence”. However, state-of-the-art deep learning and big data analytics based AI systems require tremendous computation and communication resources, causing significant latency, energy consumption, network congestion, and privacy leakage in both of the training and inference processes. By embedding model training and inference capabilities into the network edge, edge AI stands out as a disruptive technology for 6G to seamlessly integrate sensing, communication, computation, and intelligence, thereby improving the efficiency, effectiveness, privacy, and security of 6G networks. In this paper, we shall provide our vision for scalable and trustworthy edge AI systems with integrated design of wireless communication strategies and decentralized machine learning models. New design principles of wireless networks, service-driven resource allocation optimization methods, as well as a holistic end-to-end system architecture to support edge AI will be described. Standardization, software and hardware platforms, and application scenarios are also discussed to facilitate the industrialization and commercialization of edge AI systems.

AB  - Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a self-organizing network consisting of many sensor nodes situated in the monitoring area. One of the most important challenges of WSNs is to configure the network in a way to improve the quality-of-service parameters, and thus enhance the network performance and reduce energy consumption. Energy consumption increases due to several reasons such as unsuccessful delivery of packets to the receiver, re-transmission of packets, delay in packet delivery to the sink, low received signal strength, inadequate link quality, noise level, etc. Each sensor network consists of different configuration parameters including the distance between receiver and transmitter, packet arrival time, packet size, maximum queue size, maximum number of transmissions, transmission power level, etc. All the mentioned parameters will affect several indicators such as latency, received signal strength, link quality, successful/fail packet delivery, noise level, and the number of re-transmissions. Finding the relationship between these two sets of parameters and optimizing them reduce energy consumption in the network and increase network lifetime. To achieve this, an efficient and new method based on support vector regression and genetic algorithm called MSOG is presented in this paper to model and optimize wireless sensor network indicators (such as delay, received signal strength, packet arrival time, successful packet delivery). The simulation results show that MSOG has better outcomes in optimizing network parameters and indicators in comparison with a similar algorithm.

AB  - The displacement of rotational generation and the consequent reduction in system inertia is expected to have major stability and reliability impacts on modern power systems. Fast-frequency support strategies using energy storage systems (ESSs) can be deployed to maintain the inertial response of the system, but information regarding the inertial response of the system is critical for the effective implementation of such control strategies. In this paper, a moving horizon estimation (MHE)-based approach for online estimation of inertia constant of low inertia microgrids is presented. Based on the frequency measurements obtained in response to a non-intrusive excitation signal from an ESS, the inertia constant was estimated using local measurements from the ESS’s phase-locked loop. The proposed MHE formulation was first tested in a linearized power system model, followed by tests in a modified microgrid benchmark from Cordova, Alaska. Even under moderate measurement noise, the technique was able to estimate the inertia constant of the system well within ±20% of the true value. Estimates provided by the proposed method could be utilized for applications such as fast-frequency support, adaptive protection schemes, and planning and procurement of spinning reserves.

AB  - As the general development trend of the automotive industry, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be used to increase transportation safety, promote mobility choices, reduce user costs, and create new job opportunities. However, with the increasing level of connectivity and automation, malicious users are able to easily implement different kinds of attacks, which threaten the security of CAVs. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on the cyber-security in the environment of CAVs with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. Firstly, based on the types of communication networks and attack objects, it classifies various cyber-security risks and vulnerabilities in the environment of CAVs into in-vehicle network attacks, vehicle to everything network attacks, and other attacks. Next, it regards cyber-risk as another type of attacks in the environment of CAVs. Then, it describes and analyzes up-to-date corresponding defense strategies for securing CAVs. In addition, it concludes several available cyber-security and safety standards of CAVs, which is helpful for the practical application of CAVs. Finally, several challenges and open problems are discussed for the future research.

AB  - Wildfires pose a significant challenge to the natural and the built environments, as well as the safety and economic wellbeing of the communities residing in wildfire-prone areas. The electric power grid is specifically among the built environments most affected by, and contributing to, wildfires. In this paper, we propose a three lines of defense (3LD) framework for wildfire risk management in electric power infrastructure and review the literature from this lens. An overview of the physics and phenomenology of the wildfires as it relates to power grids is presented, and the logic for the proposed 3LD framework is discussed. The reviewed literature based on the 3LD theme includes the most relevant and emerging research work on wildfire prevention as the first line of defense, wildfire mitigation and proactive response as the second line of defense, and wildfire recovery preparedness as the third line of defense. This study reveals that while the state of the art, to a large extent, stands comprehensive in various aspects of power system resilience and wildfire risk management, there is a gap in the literature in addressing this emerging risk in a holistic, interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - Resilience curves are used to communicate quantitative and qualitative aspects of system behavior and resilience to stakeholders of critical infrastructure. Generally, these curves illustrate the evolution of system performance before, during, and after a disruption. As simple as these curves may appear, the literature contains underexplored nuance when defining “performance” and comparing curves with metrics. Through a critical review of 273 publications, this manuscript aims to define a common vocabulary for practitioners and researchers that will improve the use of resilience curves as a tool for assessing and designing resilient infrastructure. This vocabulary includes a taxonomy of resilience curve performance measures as well as a taxonomy of summary metrics. In addition, this review synthesizes a framework for examining assumptions of resilience analysis that are often implicit or unexamined in the practice and literature. From this vocabulary and framework comes recommendations including broader adoption of productivity measures; additional research on endogenous performance targets and thresholds; deliberate consideration of curve milestones when defining summary metrics; and cautionary fundamental flaws that may arise when condensing an ensemble of resilience curves into an “expected” trajectory.

AB  - This book explores and analyzes the rapid pace of technological evolution in diplomatic, information, military, and economic sectors, which has contributed to a dynamic international policy environment. Global political stability is greatly influenced by innovations originating from numerous sources, including university labs, the technology sector, and military research. Collectively, these innovations guide the movement of people, ideas, and technology that in turn affect the international balance of power. The objective of this volume is to develop new insights into how the proliferation of innovative ideas, low-cost weapons, and dual-use technologies impact the changing global security landscape. Innovative and dual-use technologies can be used for beneficial purposes or defensive purposes. Alternatively they may be appropriated or employed for nefarious purposes by hostile military powers and non-state actors alike. Such actions can threaten global security and stability. As the complexity of technological innovations continues to increase, existing control mechanisms such as international regulations and security arrangements may be insufficient to stem the tide of proliferation over time. As such, this works seeks to assess and present policy solutions to curtail the threat to global stability posed by the proliferation of weapons and dual-use technology.

AB  - A Playbook delegation approach was evaluated for human-autonomy teaming (HAT) in Single Pilot Operations (SPO). In SPO, a single pilot makes flight decisions, performs flight tasks, and collaborates with an autonomous teammate. The autonomous teammate shares responsibility, authority, and tasks. Challenges include the design of functions, interactions, and teaming skills. HAT often requires the ability to dynamically allocate functions, and timely methods to accurately express intent to teammates. A Playbook delegation interface was developed to enables the pilot to call and modify plays in collaboration with the autonomous teammate. Twenty pilots evaluated the Playbook interface to explore real-time function allocation, and identified teaming skills needed to support HAT. Pilots preferred the Playbook interface for better collaboration with the autonomous teammate. Interviews revealed that supporting human-like communication in HAT is critical to facilitate decision-making. Four major teaming skills (communication, coordination, cooperation, and cognition) are discussed to support HAT in SPO.

AB  - For several decades, optical networks, due to their high capacity and long-distance transmission range, have been used as the major communication technology to serve network traffic, especially in the core and metro segments of communication networks. Unfortunately, our society has often experienced how the correct functioning of these critical infrastructures can be substantially hindered by massive failures triggered by natural disasters, weather-related disruptions and malicious human activities. In this position paper, we discuss the impact on optical networks of all major classes of disaster events mentioned above, and we overview recent relevant techniques that have been proposed to increase the disaster resilience of optical networks against the various classes of disaster events. We start by presenting some proactive methods to be applied before the occurrence of a disaster. Then we move our focus also on other preparedness methods that can be executed in the (typically short) time frame between the occurrence of an early alert of an incoming disaster and the time a disaster actually hits the network. Finally, we discuss reactive procedures that allow performing post-disaster recovery operations effectively. The analysis of disaster resilience mechanisms provided in this paper covers both wired and optical wireless communication infrastructures and also contains explicit remarks covering the role of emerging technologies (e.g., fixed-mobile convergence in the 5G era and beyond) in disaster resilience.

AB  - This work is about mission planning in teams of mobile autonomous agents. We consider tasks that are spatially distributed, non-atomic, and provide an utility for integral and also partial task completion. Agents are heterogeneous, therefore showing different efficiency when dealing with the tasks. The goal is to define a system-level plan that assigns tasks to agents to maximize mission performance. We define the mission planning problem through a model including multiple sub-problems that are addressed jointly: task selection and allocation, task scheduling, task routing, control of agent proximity over time. The problem is proven to be NP-hard and is formalized as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Two solution approaches are proposed: one heuristic and one exact method. Both combine a generic MILP solver and a genetic algorithm, resulting in efficient anytime algorithms. To support performance scalability and to allow the effective use of the model when online continual replanning is required, a decentralized and fully distributed architecture is defined top-down from the MILP model. Decentralization drastically reduces computational requirements and shows good scalability at the expenses of only moderate losses in performance. Lastly, we illustrate the application of the mission planning framework in two demonstrators. These implementations show how the framework can be successfully integrated with different platforms, including mobile robots (ground and aerial), wearable computers, and smart-phone devices.

AB  - Trusted third parties (TTPs) are frequently used for serving as an authority to issue and verify transactions in applications. Although the TTP-based paradigm provides customers with convenience, it causes a whole set of inevitable problems such as security threats, privacy vulnerabilities, and censorship. The TTP-based paradigm is not suitable for all modern networks, e.g., 5G and beyond networks, which are been evolving to support ubiquitous, decentralized, and autonomous services. Driven by the vision of blockchain technologies, there has been a paradigm shift in applications, from TTP-based to decentralized-trust-based. Decentralized applications (DApps) with blockchains promise no trust on authorities, tackling the key challenges of security and privacy problems. A main thrust of blockchain research is to explore frameworks and paradigms for decentralizing applications, fostering a number of new designs ranging from network architectures to business models. Therefore, this paper provides a compact and concise survey on the state-of-the-art research of decentralizing applications with blockchain in the 5G and beyond perspective. We provide four burning 5G and beyond challenges and discuss five aspects of motivation for decentralizing applications with blockchain. Then, we define nine fundamental modules of blockchains and explain the potential influence of these modules on decentralization in depth. We also discuss the interrelation between decentralization and some desired blockchain properties. Particularly, we present the capabilities of blockchain for decentralizing applications through reviewing DApps for 5G and beyond. We clearly distinguish three blockchain paradigms and discuss how developers to make right choices for 5G and beyond. Finally, we highlight important learned lessons and open issues in applying blockchain for decentralizing applications. Lessons learned and open issues from this survey will facilitate the transformation of centralized applications to DApps.

AB  - Smart Grid technology has been considered an attractive research issue due to its efficiency in solving energy demand, storage, and power transmission. The integration of IoT technology in the Smart Grids is a critical way to accelerate the digitization of the power grid and is useful for the efficient performance of the energy grid infrastructure. For efficient real-time data analysis and decision-making, the Internet of Things will incorporate various communication systems seamlessly. To achieve efficient communication between all Internet of Things, devices are expected to use multiple means, including smart sensors, cable and wireless communication. Improved Internet of Things sensor technologies and connectivity could theoretically prevent or minimize the potential to natural disaster transmission lines, improve transmission power capacity and reduce economic losses. A smart grid is a variety of sensors, devices, and data sets that continuously capture high-resolution data equal to individual IoT conditions. A vast amount of data is one of the biggest challenges on the Internet of Things. Edge Computing is trying to process data close to linked sensors to address this problem, where the data is gathered and processed. This paper aims to investigate the edge computing solutions for the smart grid. A comprehensive review of both emerging issues and edge computing in the Smart Grid environment is discussed and explained. There are two primary components to the energy sharing process among Prosumers: information/digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence Scheduling Techniques. Each of them is mentioned in detail to discuss the Prosumer smart Grid. Furthermore, Edge Computing and classifications (cloudlet, Fog computing and Multi-Access) are among the suitable network methods mentioned in this paper. Some techniques and methodologies have been extensively covered to improve reader awareness of the Prosumer smart grid system.

AB  - Network Service Providers (NSPs) envisage to support the divergent and stringent requirements of future services by instantiating these services as service chains, commonly referred to as Service Function Chains (SFCs), that are customized and configured to meet specific service requirements. However, due to the limited footprint of the Infrastructure Providers (InPs), these SFCs may have to transcend multiple InPs/domains. In this regard, determining the optimal set of InPs in which to embed the SFC request emerges as a complex problem for several reasons. First, the large number of possible combinations for selecting the InPs to embed the different sub-chains of the request makes this problem computationally complex, rendering optimal solutions only after long computations, especially in large scale networks, which is unfeasible for delay sensitive applications. Second, the unwillingness of InPs to disclose their internal information, which may be vital for making embedding decisions, usually implies the provisioning of single-domain solutions, which are unsuitable in this working scenario. In this regard, this paper first formulates the multi-domain service deployment problem under multiple request constraints, such as bandwidth or delay, among others. Then, due to the NP-hardness nature of the above problem, this paper proposes an algorithm that is aided by a multi-stage graph for computing a request embedding solution in a distributed manner, solving the problem in acceptable run-times. Results from different simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm is optimized in terms of acceptance ratio and embedding cost, with up to 60.0% and 88.7% improvements in terms of embedding cost and execution time, respectively, for some scenarios, in comparison with a benchmark state-of-the-art algorithm.

AB  - Industrial Internet of Thing (IIoT) systems are considered attractive ransomware targets because they operate critical services that affect human lives and have substantial operational costs. The major concern is with brownfield IIoT systems since they have legacy edge systems that are not fully prepared to integrate with IoT technologies. Various existing security solutions can detect and mitigate such attacks but are often ineffective due to the heterogeneous and distributed nature of the IIoT systems and their interoperability demands. Consequently, developing new detection solutions is essential. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel targeted ransomware detection model tailored for IIoT edge systems. It uses Asynchronous Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning (AP2PFL) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques as a targeted ransomware detection algorithm. The proposed model consists of two modules: 1) Data Purifying Module (DPM) aims to refine and reconstruct a valuable and robust representation of data based on Contractive Denoising Auto-Encoder (CDAE), and 2) Diagnostic and Decision Module (DDM) is used to identify targeted ransomware and its stages based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Batch Normalization (BN). The main strengths of this proposed model include: 1) each edge gateway’s modules work cooperatively with its neighbors in an asynchronous manner and without a third party, 2) it deals with both homogeneous and heterogeneous data, and 3) it is robust against evasion attacks. An exhaustive set of experiments on three datasets prove the high effectiveness of the proposed model in detecting targeted ransomware (known and unknown attacks) in brownfield IIoT and the superiority over the state-of-the-art models.

AB  - The world population currently stands at about 7 billion amidst an expected increase in 2030 from 9.4 billion to around 10 billion in 2050. This burgeoning population has continued to influence the upward demand for animal food. Moreover, the management of finite resources such as land, the need to reduce livestock contribution to greenhouse gases, and the need to manage inherent complex, highly contextual, and repetitive day-to-day livestock management (LsM) routines are some examples of challenges to overcome in livestock production. The Internet of Things (IoT)’s usefulness in other vertical industries (OVI) shows that its role will be significant in LsM. This work uses the systematic review methodology of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to guide a review of existing literature on IoT in OVI. The goal is to identify the IoT’s ecosystem, architecture, and its technicalities—present status, opportunities, and expected future trends—regarding its role in LsM. Among identified IoT roles in LsM, the authors found that data will be its main contributor. The traditional approach of reactive data processing will give way to the proactive approach of augmented analytics to provide insights about animal processes. This will undoubtedly free LsM from the drudgery of repetitive tasks with opportunities for improved productivity.

AB  - Engineering design (ED) is the process of solving technical problems within requirements and constraints to create new artifacts. Data science (DS) is the inter-disciplinary field that uses computational systems to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data. The synergies between these two fields have a long story and throughout the past decades, ED has increasingly benefited from an integration with DS. We present a literature review at the intersection between ED and DS, identifying the tools, algorithms and data sources that show the most potential in contributing to ED, and identifying a set of challenges that future data scientists and designers should tackle, to maximize the potential of DS in supporting effective and efficient designs. A rigorous scoping review approach has been supported by Natural Language Processing techniques, in order to offer a review of research across two fuzzy-confining disciplines. The paper identifies challenges related to the two fields of research and to their interfaces. The main gaps in the literature revolve around the adaptation of computational techniques to be applied in the peculiar context of design, the identification of data sources to boost design research and a proper featurization of this data. The challenges have been classified considering their impacts on ED phases and applicability of DS methods, giving a map for future research across the fields. The scoping review shows that to fully take advantage of DS tools there must be an increase in the collaboration between design practitioners and researchers in order to open new data driven opportunities.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) tsunami, public embracement, and the ubiquitous adoption of smart devices are affecting virtually every industry, directly or indirectly. The success of the current and future landscape of IoT and connected devices requires service provision characterized by scalability, ubiquity, reliability, and high-performance, among others. In order to achieve this attribution, the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing (CC), known as cloud IoT, has emerged as a new paradigm providing advanced services specific to aggregating, storing, and processing data generated by IoT. While the convergence of IoT and Cloud brings opportunities, it suffers from specific limitations such as bandwidth, latency, and connectivity. The increasing need for supporting interaction between cloud and IoT led to Edge and Fog Computing (FC) in which computing and storage resources are located not only in the cloud but also at the edges near the source of data. The hierarchical and collaborative edge-fog-cloud architecture brings tremendous benefits as it enables us to distribute the intelligence and computation — including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and big data analytics — to achieve an optimal solution while satisfying the given constraints e.g., delay-energy tradeoff. Due to the hierarchical, cross-layer, and distributed nature of this model, achieving an osmotic and effective convergence of IoT, edge, fog, and cloud computing requires overcoming many challenges with respect to design and implementation, as well as deployment and evaluation. This paper provides a comprehensive insight into the edge-fog-cloud computing paradigm by providing a blend of discussions on all important aspects of the underlying technologies to offer opportunities for more holistic studies and to accelerate knowledge acquisition. To gain a holistic understanding of edge-fog-cloud, we will begin this paper by providing an in-depth tutorial and presenting the main requirements, state-of-the-art reference architectures, building blocks, components, protocols, applications, and other similar computing paradigms, including their similarities and differences. Following this, we present a reference architecture for edge-fog-cloud IoT and discuss the major topics and considerations for the design and deployment of practical edge-fog-cloud computing systems, such as service models, infrastructure design, provisioning, resource allocation, offloading, service migration, performance evaluation, and security concerns. Next, we will take a look at the role of privacy-preserving, distributed, and collaborative analytics as well as the interaction between edge, fog, and cloud computing. Finally, we will overview the main challenges in the field of edge-fog-cloud computing that need to be trackled to realize the full potential of IoT.

AB  - Many current AI and machine learning algorithms and data and information fusion processes attempt in software to estimate situations in our complex world of nested feedback loops. Such algorithms and processes must gracefully and efficiently adapt to technical challenges such as data quality induced by these loops, and interdependencies that vary in complexity, space, and time. To realize effective and efficient designs of computational systems, a Systems Engineering perspective may provide a framework for identifying the interrelationships and patterns of change between components rather than static snapshots. We must study cascading interdependencies through this perspective to understand their behavior and to successfully adopt complex system-of-systems in society. This book derives in part from the presentations given at the AAAI 2021 Spring Symposium session on Leveraging Systems Engineering to Realize Synergistic AI / Machine Learning Capabilities. Its 16 chapters offer an emphasis on pragmatic aspects and address topics in systems engineering; AI, machine learning, and reasoning; data and information fusion; intelligent systems; autonomous systems; interdependence and teamwork; human-computer interaction; trust; and resilience.

AB  - In recent years, the emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) aims to enhance the users’ quality of experience through proposing more sophisticated services ranging from guaranteeing the user safety to improving his comfort. The IoV ecosystem is complex, heterogeneous, and evolving. Many entities participate to compose its architecture (such as vehicles, humans, roadside units, ITS). Moreover, different communication types co-exist to ensure the IoV connectivity and continuity. This diversity leads to new security requirements that seem more complex to take into account and enlarge the attack surface of such ecosystem. Many security mechanisms should be considered to enforce the security of IoV environment at many levels: data, entities, communications, storage, etc.. Trust management is one of the potential security mechanisms that aims to increase the reliability within the IoV environment. The topic has been widely explored within the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, the VANET represents only one component of the IoV ecosystem. Thus, the approaches proposed for the VANET should be adapted to be applied for the IoV. Moreover, the advent of the emerging technologies like blockchain, cloud, SDN as well as artificial intelligence bring new opportunities to propose more relevant approaches within the trust management mechanisms within the IoV context. Accordingly, this survey deals with the literature about the trust management topic in vehicular environments. The scope considers the IoV environment as well as the relevant approaches proposed for the VANET context since it is one of the important component of the IoV ecosystem. We start by quickly reviewing the existing surveys about security of the vehicular environments. Then, we give a general overview about trust concepts. Afterwards, we present the security and trust challenges and attacks in the vehicular context. Later, we classify and compare the most relevant approaches related to the trust management for the IoV proposing a new taxonomy. We complete this survey by highlighting the open future directions and perspectives for research.

AB  - This book assesses potential developments of terrorism and ways to prevent it—the growing threats as new technologies become available — and how the same new technologies may help trap those with potential mal-intent. The drumbeat of terror resonates from everywhere; how can we stop it? What are the tripping points along the road and how can we avoid them? Increasingly more people have access to increasingly more information and increasingly more destructive technologies. In the meantime, increasingly advanced technologies help us create an increasingly safer and more harmonious world. Advantages and disadvantages are accelerating each other. While hybrid threats are intensifying, so are the opportunities to address them. But what are the compromises and how can we mitigate them? This book also looks at the unexpected and often random success and failure of policies to counter the evolving terror threat. The various aspects of the terrorism phenomena are presented in a unique way using scenario vignettes, which give the reader a realistic perception of the threat. The combination of positive and negative implications of emerging technologies is describing what might well be one of the most important dimensions of our common future.

AB  - Power beaming is the efficient point-to-point transfer of electrical energy across free space by a directive electromagnetic beam. This paper clarifies the basic principles of power beaming in simple terms, and proposes a benchmarking methodology for improving the comparative assessment of power beaming systems and technology. An in-depth historical overview tracing the worldwide progress in microwave and millimeter wave (mmWave) experimental demonstrations over the past 60 years shows clear evidence of a significant increase in activity during the last 5 years. In addition, a review of progress in scalable rectenna arrays for the reception of microwave power beaming shows sufficient maturity for new research to initiate on the ruggedization, productization, and system integration aspects of the technology. A review of regulatory issues including spectrum management and safety indicates the need for additional technical solutions and international coordination. Breaking results reported in this paper include 1) data from the first in-orbit flight test of a solar-to-RF sandwich module, 2) the construction of multiple US in-orbit demonstrations, planned for 2023 launch, that will demonstrate key technologies for space-based solar power, and 3) a 100-kWmmWave power beaming transmitter demonstrating inherent human life safety.

AB  - Multimodal data fusion (MMDF) is the process of combining disparate data streams (of different dimensionality, resolution, type, etc.) to generate information in a form that is more understandable or usable. Despite the explosion of data availability in recent decades, as yet there is no well-developed theoretical basis for multimodal data fusion, i.e., no way to determine a priori which approach is best suited to combine an arbitrary set of available data to achieve a stated goal for a given application. This has resulted in exploration of a wide variety of approaches across numerous domains but as yet very little integration of conclusions at a meta (cross-disciplinary) level. In response, this manuscript poses the following questions: (1) How convergent (or divergent) are approaches within single disciplines? (2) How similar are the challenges posed across different disciplines, i.e., might there be opportunity for successes in MMDF achieved in one field to inform progress in other areas as well? and (3) Where are the outstanding gaps in MMDF research, and what does this imply as targets for high impact research in the coming years? To begin to answer these questions, an apples-to-apples comparison of the literature of nine stakeholder-centric engineering domains (civil engineering, transportation, energy, environmental engineering, food engineering, critical care (healthcare), neuroscience, manufacturing/automation, and robotics) was created by quantifying the numbers and dimensionalities of modalities and sensors in each published project and classifying the algorithms used and purposes for which they are used. Within disciplines, it is shown there is often a tendency for use of similar methodologies, both in choice of level of fusion and data algorithm class. Yet this analysis also reveals that many problem types (defined by data dimensionality, modality number and type, and fusion purpose) are shared across different domains and are approached differently in those domains, e.g., transportation problems have similar characteristics to critical care, food science, robotics, and civil engineering. Of the disciplines studied, most ( > 75 %) share problem characteristics with 3–5 others; to support leveraging these resources, lookup tables indexed by data dimensions, number of modalities, etc. are provided as a starting point for cross-disciplinary MMDF literature searches for new applications. Critical gaps identified are (1) a drop off of the number of published studies with increasing number of distinct modalities and (2) a dearth of publications tackling challenges with high dimensionality inputs, especially time-series 2D and 3D data. These gaps may point to topics where algorithm development will be fruitful to enable future solutions as video and other high-dimensionality sensors decrease in price. Finally, the lack of a shared vocabulary across disciplines makes analyses like the one conducted here challenging, as does the often implicit incorporation of expert knowledge into design; therefore progress toward a better leveraging of the current state of knowledge and toward a theoretical MMDF framework depends critically on improved cross-disciplinary communication and coordination on this topic.

AB  - This open access book is the first to systematically introduce the principles of urban informatics and its application to every aspect of the city that involves its functioning, control, management, and future planning. It introduces new models and tools being developed to understand and implement these technologies that enable cities to function more efficiently – to become ‘smart’ and ‘sustainable’. The smart city has quickly emerged as computers have become ever smaller to the point where they can be embedded into the very fabric of the city, as well as being central to new ways in which the population can communicate and act. When cities are wired in this way, they have the potential to become sentient and responsive, generating massive streams of ‘big’ data in real time as well as providing immense opportunities for extracting new forms of urban data through crowdsourcing. This book offers a comprehensive review of the methods that form the core of urban informatics from various kinds of urban remote sensing to new approaches to machine learning and statistical modelling. It provides a detailed technical introduction to the wide array of tools information scientists need to develop the key urban analytics that are fundamental to learning about the smart city, and it outlines ways in which these tools can be used to inform design and policy so that cities can become more efficient with a greater concern for environment and equity.

AB  - The effects of climate change are beginning to be felt around the world with rising temperatures, changing precipitation levels, more frequent and severe storms and longer more intensive droughts threatening human life and livelihoods and damaging property and infrastructure. As such, society in all countries – both developing and developed – need to increase their resilience to the impacts of climate change, where resilience is the ability of a system to absorb stresses and adapt in ways that improve the overall sustainability of the system; enabling it to be better prepared for future climate change impacts. In this context, a climate resilient society is one that is: reflective (learns from experiences); robust (both people and infrastructure can withstand the impacts of extreme conditions); forward-thinking (with plans made to ensure systems function during extreme events); flexible (so systems and plans can change, evolve or adopt alternative strategies); resourceful (to respond quickly to extreme events); inclusive (so all communities including the vulnerable are involved in planning); and integrated (so people, systems, decision-making and investments are mutually supportive of common goals). The Climate Resilient Societies Major Reference Work includes chapters covering a range of themes that provide readers with an invaluable overview on how various levels of government have attempted to create climate resilient societies. In particular, each chapter, under its respective theme, will address how a government, or series of governments, at various levels in non-OECD and/or OECD countries, have implemented innovative climate resilient policies that seek synergies across strategies, choices and actions, in an attempt to build a climate resilient society. Each chapter will address one specific sub-theme out of the population of themes covered in the Major Reference Work: Water, Energy, Agriculture and Food, Built environment and Infrastructure, Transport, Human health, Society, Disaster, Business and Economy, and Financing Climate Resilience.

AB  - This book presents sensemaking strategies to support security planning and design. Threats to security are becoming complex and multifaceted and increasingly challenging traditional notions of security. The security landscape is characterized as ‘messes’ and ‘wicked problems’ that proliferate in this age of complexity. Designing security solutions in the face of interconnectedness, volatility and uncertainty, we run the risk of providing the right answer to the wrong problem thereby resulting in unintended consequences. Sensemaking is the activity that enables us to turn the ongoing complexity of the world into a “situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action” (Weick, Sutcliffe, Obstfeld, 2005). It is about creating an emerging picture of our world through data collection, analysis, action, and reflection. The importance of sensemaking to security is that it enables us to plan, design and act when the world as we knew it seems to have shifted. Leveraging the relevant theoretical grounding and thought leadership in sensemaking, key examples are provided, thereby illustrating how sensemaking strategies can support security planning and design. This is a critical analytical and leadership requirement in this age of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity that characterizes the security landscape. This book is useful for academics, graduate students in global security, and government and security planning practitioners.

AB  - This book provides a broad overview of the benefits from a Systems Engineering design philosophy in architecting complex systems composed of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and humans situated in chaotic environments. The major topics include emergence, verification and validation of systems using AI/ML and human systems integration to develop robust and effective human-machine teams—where the machines may have varying degrees of autonomy due to the sophistication of their embedded AI/ML. The chapters not only describe what has been learned, but also raise questions that must be answered to further advance the general Science of Autonomy. The science of how humans and machines operate as a team requires insights from, among others, disciplines such as the social sciences, national and international jurisprudence, ethics and policy, and sociology and psychology. The social sciences inform how context is constructed, how trust is affected when humans and machines depend upon each other and how human-machine teams need a shared language of explanation. National and international jurisprudence determine legal responsibilities of non-trivial human-machine failures, ethical standards shape global policy, and sociology provides a basis for understanding team norms across cultures. Insights from psychology may help us to understand the negative impact on humans if AI/ML based machines begin to outperform their human teammates and consequently diminish their value or importance. This book invites professionals and the curious alike to witness a new frontier open as the Science of Autonomy emerges.

AB  - This book focuses on an overview of the AI techniques, their foundations, their applications, and remaining challenges and open problems. Many artificial intelligence (AI) techniques do not explain their recommendations. Providing natural-language explanations for numerical AI recommendations is one of the main challenges of modern AI. To provide such explanations, a natural idea is to use techniques specifically designed to relate numerical recommendations and natural-language descriptions, namely fuzzy techniques. This book is of interest to practitioners who want to use fuzzy techniques to make AI applications explainable, to researchers who may want to extend the ideas from these papers to new application areas, and to graduate students who are interested in the state-of-the-art of fuzzy techniques and of explainable AI—in short, to anyone who is interested in problems involving fuzziness and AI in general.

AB  - The Encyclopedia of Systems and Control collects a broad range of short expository articles that describe the current state of the art in the central topics of control and systems engineering as well as in many of the related fields in which control is an enabling technology. The editors have assembled the most comprehensive reference possible, and this has been greatly facilitated by the publisher’s commitment to continuously publish updates to the articles as they become available in the future. Although control engineering is now a mature discipline, it remains an area in which there is a great deal of research activity, and as new developments in both theory and applications become available, they will be included in the online version of the encyclopedia. A carefully chosen team of leading authorities in the field has written the well over 300 articles, 50 of them new in the second edition. The topics range from basic principles of feedback in servomechanisms to advanced topics such as the control of Boolean networks and evolutionary game theory and this range has also been expanded to include material on such subjects as the Internet of Things, quantum control and smart grids. Because the content has been selected to reflect both foundational importance and subjects that are of current interest to the research and practitioner communities, a broad readership that includes students, application engineers, and research scientists will find entries that are of interest.

            The underlying probabilistic theory for quantum mechanics is non-Kolmogorovian. The time-order in which physical observables are measured will be important if they are incompatible (non-commuting). In particular, the notion of conditioning needs to be handled with care and may not even exist in some cases. Here we layout the quantum probabilistic formulation in terms of von Neumann algebras and outline conditions (non-demolition properties) under which filtering may occur.

AB  - Abstract
            Image segmentation is a fundamental problem in image processing, computer vision, and medical imaging applications. The design of generic, automated methods that work for various objects and imaging modalities is a daunting task. Instead of proposing new specific segmentation algorithms, in this entry, we review a general design principle on how to integrate user interactions from the perspective of feedback control theory. In particular, impulsive control and Lyapunov stability analysis are employed to design and analyze an interactive segmentation system. Stabilization conditions are derived to guide algorithm design. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodologies are demonstrated.

AB  - Abstract
            Recent cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures, such as power systems and nuclear facilities, have shown that malicious, advanced attacks on control and monitoring systems are a serious concern. These systems rely on tight integration of cyber and physical components, implying that cyberattacks may have serious physical consequences. This has led to an increased interest for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security, and we here review some of the fundamental problems considered. We review basic modeling of the CPS components in networked control systems and how to model a cyberattack. We discuss different classes of attack strategies and the resources required. Particular attention is given to analysis of detectability and impact of attacks. For the system operator, attack mitigation is a particular concern, and we review some common strategies. Finally, we point out future directions for research.

            A batch process is characterized by the repetition of time-varying operations of finite duration. Due to the repetition, there are two independent “time” variables, namely, the run time during a batch and the batch counter. Accordingly, the control and optimization objectives can be defined for a given batch or over several batches. This entry describes the various control and optimization strategies available for the operation of batch processes. These include conventional feedback control, predictive control, iterative learning control, and run-to-run control on the one hand and model-based repeated optimization and model-free self-optimizing schemes on the other.

AB  - Abstract
            The design of feedback control systems in industry is often carried out using frequency-response (FR) methods. Frequency-response design is used primarily because it provides good designs in the face of uncertainty in the plant model. For example, for systems with poorly known or changing high-frequency resonances, we can temper the feedback design to alleviate the effects of those uncertainties. This tempering can be carried out more easily using FR design without extensive modeling of the uncertainties. The method is most effective for systems that are stable in open loop; however, it can also be applied to systems with instabilities. This article will introduce the reader to methods of design using lead and lag compensation. It will also cover the use of FR design to reduce steady-state errors and to improve robustness to uncertainties in high-frequency dynamics.

AB  - Abstract
            State controllability and observability are key properties in linear input–output systems in state-space form. In the state-space approach, the relation between inputs and outputs is represented using the state variables of the system. A natural question is then to what extent it is possible to manipulate the values of the state vector by means of an appropriate choice of the input function. The concepts of controllability, reachability, and null controllability address this issue. Another important question is whether it is possible to uniquely determine the values of the state vector from knowledge of the input and output signals over a given time interval. This question is dealt with using the concept of observability.

            The reader is introduced to the predictor feedback method for the control of general nonlinear systems with input delays of arbitrary length. The delays need not necessarily be constant but can be time-varying or state-dependent. The predictor feedback methodology employs a model-based construction of the (unmeasurable) future state of the system. The analysis methodology is based on the concept of infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation – a transformation that converts the overall feedback system to a new, cascade “target system” whose stability can be studied with the construction of a Lyapunov function.

AB  - Abstract
            Control of additive manufacturing (AM) processes involves delivery of material and energy to precise locations at prescribed times during the manufacturing process. While each process is distinct and thus the challenges associated with designing control algorithms are unique, motion control and process control are the two primary objectives in all AM processes. Standard motion control strategies are used to position nozzles, motion stages, and steering mirrors. Model-free feedback and feedforward design strategies such as PID and iterative learning control are often used for process control of low-level process variables. On the other hand, geometry and part-level control strategies are designed through physics-based in-layer and layer-to-layer models built on momentum, mass, and/or energy balance equations.

AB  - Abstract
            Circadian rhythms are cyclical behaviors observed in many biological processes, which form a mechanism with which living beings can synchronize with the light and dark pattern of the terrestrial day. In humans, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) functions as the central circadian pacemaker. Misalignment between the circadian rhythms and the solar day, for example, in the case of jetlag or rotating shift work, leads to negative health consequences and lower productivity. The central circadian pacemaker is driven by light stimuli and coupled with other physiological processes. The sleep process, for example, is known to be modulated by the central circadian rhythm. In this chapter, we discuss the formulation of various control problems related to the regulation of circadian rhythms using light as the control input. We aim at shifting the phase of the circadian oscillation as quickly as possible. In some cases, we include constraints that involve sleep scheduling. In all cases, the problems are formulated as continuous-time optimal control problems.

            A review of characteristics-based approaches to optimal control computation is presented for nonlinear deterministic systems described by ordinary differential equations. We recall Pontryagin’s principle which gives necessary optimality conditions for open-loop control strategies. The related framework of generalized characteristics for first-order Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations is discussed as a theoretical tool that bridges the gap between the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions. We point out widely used numerical techniques for obtaining optimal open-loop control strategies (in particular for state-constrained problems) and how indirect (characteristics based) and direct methods may reasonably be combined. A possible transition from open-loop to feedback constructions is also described. Moreover, we discuss approaches for attenuating the curse of dimensionality for certain classes of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations.

Second, future maritime operations are discussed with reference to a paradigm shift: from robotic systems to systems of robotic systems. Finally, the control and computation challenges posed by future robotic operations are discussed in the framework of cyber-physical systems in which physical and computational entities co-evolve, interact, and communicate in an environment that can also be modified by the actions of these entities. This will be done with reference to modular design, systems of systems, models of systems with evolving structure, optimization and execution control for extended space-control spaces, and hierarchical control architectures.

AB  - Abstract
            Closed-loop control can significantly improve the performance of bioprocesses, e.g., by an increase of the production rate and yield of a target molecule or by guaranteeing reproducibility of the production together with low by-product formation. In contrast to control of chemical reaction systems, the biological reactions take place inside cells which constitute highly regulated, i.e., internally controlled systems by themselves. As a result, through evolution, the same cell can and will mimic a system of first order in some situations and a high-dimensional, highly nonlinear system in others. This makes supervision, control, and optimization of biosystems very demanding, and a significant amount of control design effort has to be put in the mathematical modeling in the first place.

AB  - Abstract
            Process control performance is a cornerstone of operational excellence in a broad spectrum of industries such as refining, petrochemicals, pulp and paper, mineral processing, power systems, and wastewater treatment. Control performance assessment and monitoring applications have become mainstream in these industries and are changing the maintenance methodology surrounding control assets from predictive to condition based. The large numbers of these assets on most sites compared to the number of maintenance and control personnel have made monitoring and diagnosing control problems challenging. For this reason, automated controller performance monitoring technologies have been readily embraced by these industries.
            This entry discusses the theory as well as practical application of controller performance monitoring tools as a requisite for monitoring and maintaining basic as well as advanced process control (APC) assets in the process industry. The section begins with the introduction to the theory of performance assessment as a technique for assessing the performance of the basic control loops in a plant. Performance assessment allows detection of performance degradation in the basic control loops in a plant by monitoring the variance in the process variable and comparing it to that of a minimum variance controller. Other metrics of controller performance are also reviewed. The resulting indices of performance give an indication of the level of performance of the controller and an indication of the action required to improve its performance; the diagnosis of poor performance may lead one to look at remediation alternatives such as retuning controller parameters or process reengineering to reduce delays or implementation of feed-forward control or attribute poor performance to faulty actuators or other process nonlinearities.

            Quantum control theory is concerned with the control of systems whose dynamics are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Quantum control may take the form of open-loop quantum control or quantum feedback control. Also, quantum feedback control may consist of measurement-based feedback control, in which the controller is a classical system governed by the laws of classical physics. Alternatively, quantum feedback control may take the form of coherent feedback control in which the controller is a quantum system governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. In the area of open-loop quantum control, questions of controllability along with optimal control and Lyapunov control methods are discussed. In the case of quantum feedback control, LQG and H∞ control methods are discussed.

Physiology-based models and artificial neural networks have been applied. Both approaches have shown superiority over traditional dosing schemes.

AB  - Abstract
            An essential role in nanotechnology applications is played by nanopositioning control systems, which allow nanometer-scale precision and accuracy at dimensions of tens of nanometers or less. Nanopositioners are precision mechatronics systems aiming at moving or identifying objects over a certain distance with a resolution of the order of a nanometer. In nanopositioners, actuation, position sensing, and feedback control are the key components that determine how successfully the stringent requirements on resolution, accuracy, stability, and bandwidth are achieved. Historically, nanopositioning found its earlier applications in scanning probe microscopy. Today it turns out to be increasingly important for lithography tools, semiconductor inspection systems, molecular biology, metrology, nanofabrication, and nanomanufacturing. Moreover, nanopositioning control represents a fundamental requirement in storage systems ranging from probe-based storage devices to mechatronic tape drive systems to achieve ultrahigh areal density and storage capacity.

            Several natural and man-made systems are often represented as complex networks, since their dynamic behavior depends to a large extent upon the properties of their interconnection structure. Electrical power grids, mass transportation systems, and cellular networks are instances of modern technological networks, while metabolic and brain networks are biological examples. The ability to control and reconfigure complex networks via external controls is fundamental to guarantee reliable and efficient network functionalities. In this note, we review recent advances and methods that characterize fundamental controllability properties and limitations of network systems.

AB  - Abstract
            This is a selective survey of technologies for the coordinated control of vehicles. The vehicles are connected: they may communicate with each other and with the infrastructure. Moreover, some vehicle planning and actuation functions are coordinated and automated, i.e., determined by on-board or (cloud-based) infrastructure processors. The entry emphasizes technologies that use communication to coordinate the movement of vehicles and deemphasizes developments that focus on autonomous driving. Hence, sensing, planning, and control technologies that are oriented to autonomous (driver-less) vehicles are not considered. The entry evaluates coordinated control technologies in terms of their contribution to greater safety, mobility, and efficiency of the US road transportation system. Safety benefits translate to reduced crash rates; mobility improvements lead to increased throughput of the road system; and higher efficiency means reduced energy consumption for a given pattern of traffic.

AB  - Abstract
            The automated insulin delivery (AID) device known as an artificial pancreas (AP) contains a closed-loop feedback controller that enables glucose management for those with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The AP system is comprised of two elements: devices and software. Devices include insulin delivery devices and glucose sensors, while software includes the user interface and the control algorithm. Decision support systems (DSS) also support treatment decisions for those with diabetes mellitus if the user does not use a closed-loop system. This chapter is divided into three sections, beginning with a description of controller components, design objectives, the challenges and the limitations of AID devices. This discussion is followed by recent advances in closed-loop clinical trials, common control algorithms, and clinical challenges. Finally, general expectations for future developments within AID engineering and clinical translation are outlined.

            This entry gives a brief overview of the recent developments in audio sound reproduction via modern sampled-data control theory. We first review basics in the current sound processing technology and then proceed to the new idea derived from sampled-data control theory, which is different from the conventional Shannon paradigm based on the perfect band-limiting hypothesis. The hybrid nature of sampled-data systems provides an optimal platform for dealing with signal processing where the ultimate objective is to reconstruct the original analog signal one started with. After discussing some fundamental problems in the Shannon paradigm, we give our basic problem formulation that can be solved using modern sampled-data control theory. Examples are given to illustrate the results.

AB  - Abstract
            The undesirable effects of roll motion of ships (rocking about the longitudinal axis) became noticeable in the mid-nineteenth century when significant changes were introduced to the design of ships as a result of sails being replaced by steam engines and the arrangement being changed from broad to narrow hulls. The combination of these changes led to lower transverse stability (lower restoring moment for a given angle of roll) with the consequence of larger roll motion. The increase in roll motion and its effect on cargo and human performance lead to the development several control devices that aimed at reducing and controlling roll motion. The control devices most commonly used today are fin stabilizers, rudder, anti-roll tanks, and gyrostabilizers. The use of different types of actuators for control of ship roll motion has been amply demonstrated for over 100 years. Performance, however, can still fall short of expectations because of difficulties associated with control system design, which have proven to be far from trivial due to fundamental performance limitations and large variations of the spectral characteristics of wave-induced roll motion. This short article provides an overview of the fundamentals of control design for ship roll motion reduction. The overview is limited to the most common control devices. Most of the material is based on Perez (Ship motion control. Advances in industrial control. Springer, London, 2005) and Perez and Blanke (Ann Rev Control 36(1):1367–5788, 2012).

Indeed, these motion systems perform the positioning with high speed and accuracy, where typical requirements are in the micrometer or even nanometer range. This is achieved through a mechatronic system design, which includes actuators, sensors, mechanics, and control. The aim of this entry is to outline advanced motion control for precision mechatronics. Both feedback and feedforward control are covered. Their specific designs are heavily influenced by considerations regarding efficient and accurate modeling techniques. Extensions to complex multivariable systems are outlined, as well as challenges induced by envisaged future application requirements.

            This entry introduces security issues in cyber-physical systems mainly from two perspectives: one is to analyze the attack effectiveness from the malicious attacker’s perspective and the other is to design the attack detection mechanism and control scheme from the system designer’s perspective. For the first research aspect, existing works focused on the worst-case performance degradation analysis when the system is under a certain type of attack are introduced, among which DoS attack and integrity attack are of the most interest. For the second research aspect, existing works providing countermeasures to detect the existence of attacks and proposing resilient estimation and control methodologies against hostile attacks are introduced. The main framework of cyber-physical systems is provided, and solid results about security issues are reviewed from selected high-quality journal papers in this entry.

            Cyber-physical-human systems (CPHS) is an emerging field where the human, the physical system, and enabling cyber technologies are interconnected through complex interactions to accomplish a certain goal. This sharply contrasts with a conventional perspective where the human is treated as an isolated element who operates or uses the system. In this entry, we provide a general introduction to CPHS and present representative examples from the recent literature. CPHS is a growing field, and currently there are no agreed upon definitions about what constitutes a CPHS or not. Therefore, the entry mainly reflects the authors’ current understanding of the topic.

Though the amount of active and/or reactive power provided individually by each of these resources can be very small, their presence in large numbers in power distribution networks implies that, under proper coordination mechanisms, they can collectively provide substantial active and reactive power regulation capacity. In this entry, we provide a simple formulation of the DER coordination problem for enabling their utilization to provide ancillary services. We also provide specific architectures and algorithmic solutions to solve the DER coordination problem, with focus on decentralized solutions.

            Control structure selection deals with selecting what to control (outputs), what to measure and what to manipulate (inputs), and also how to split the controller in a hierarchical and decentralized manner. The most important issue is probably the selection of the controlled variables (outputs), CV = Hy, where y are the available measurements and H is a degree of freedom that is seldom treated in a systematic manner by control engineers. This entry discusses how to find H for both for the upper (slower) economic layer and the lower (faster) regulatory layer in the control hierarchy. Each layer may be split in a decentralized fashion. Systematic approaches for input/output (IO) selection are presented.

            The presence of time delays in dynamical systems may induce complex behavior, and this behavior is not always intuitive. Even if a system’s equation is scalar, oscillations may occur. Time delays in control loops are usually associated with degradation of performance and robustness, but, at the same time, there are situations where time delays are used as controller parameters. In the chapter, basis properties of time-delay systems are described, and an overview of delay effects in control systems is presented.

AB  - Abstract
            For many engineering analysis and design problems, one can think about various different types of algorithms with quite different features. Depending on the specific application, “general”, “practical”, and even “optimal” may have different meanings. In this chapter, we will be following the standards defined in the theory of computation, (Garey, Johnson (1979) Computers and intractability, a guide to the theory of NP-completeness. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco; Papadimitriou (1995) Computational complexity. Addison-Wesley/Longman, Reading), but we also would like to present an engineering interpretation of these concepts. First of all, an algorithm is considered as “general”, if it really provides a correct answer for all cases of the problem. Although this makes perfect sense from a scientific perspective, it may be too restrictive from an engineering/economical viewpoint. For example, a technique which can be used for most cases may also be considered as “general” enough. An algorithm is considered as “practical” if its execution time is reasonable. From a scientific perspective, the worst case execution time looks more appealing, but for many engineering projects average execution time may be more meaningful. Similarly, there is no universally definition for reasonable execution time, but most scientists and engineers agree that polynomial execution time is reasonable, and anything beyond that is not. In this entry, we will look at some of the classical robust control problems, and try to present an engineering interpretation of the relevant computational complexity results.

AB  - Abstract
            Heart failure is a disease that happens when the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood into the circulatory system to support other organs in the body. A left ventricular assist device (or LVAD) is a mechanical pump that may be implanted in patients who suffer from advanced heart failure to assist their heart in its pumping function. The pump is connected from the left ventricle to the aorta and forms a parallel path of blood flow into the circulatory system. The latest generation of these devices consists of rotary pumps, which are generally much smaller, lighter, and quieter than the first-generation pulsatile-type pumps. The LVAD is controlled by varying the pump rotor speed to adjust the amount of blood flow contributed by the device. If the patient is in a healthcare facility, the rotor speed can be adjusted manually by a trained clinician. An important limitation facing the increased use of these devices is the desire to allow the patient to return home and resume a normal lifestyle. This limitation may be overcome if a physiological controller can be developed to automatically adjust the pump speed based on the patient’s need for blood flow. Although several possible experimental controllers have recently been developed and tested in laboratory settings, the current practice remains limited to the pump speed being adjusted by the physician and fixed at a constant setting before allowing the patient to leave the healthcare facility. The development of a physiological controller for the continuous flow rotary LVAD remains an important challenge that has occupied LVAD researchers and engineers for the past several decades.

AB  - This book highlights the latest technologies and applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the domain of construction engineering and management. The construction industry worldwide has been a late bloomer to adopting digital technology, where construction projects are predominantly managed with a heavy reliance on the knowledge and experience of construction professionals. AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing, and intelligent algorithms (e.g., neural networks, process mining, and deep learning), allowing the computer to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. It provides a wide range of solutions to address many challenging construction problems, such as knowledge discovery, risk estimates, root cause analysis, damage assessment and prediction, and defect detection. A tremendous transformation has taken place in the past years with the emerging applications of AI. This enables industrial participants to operate projects more efficiently and safely, not only increasing the automation and productivity in construction but also enhancing the competitiveness globally.

AB  - This work is a large, powerfully illustrated interdisciplinary natural sciences volume, the first of its kind to examine the critically important nature of ecological paradox, through an abundance of lenses: the biological sciences, taxonomy, archaeology, geopolitical history, comparative ethics, literature, philosophy, the history of science, human geography, population ecology, epistemology, anthropology, demographics, and futurism. The ecological paradox suggests that the human biological–and from an insular perspective, successful–struggle to exist has come at the price of isolating H. sapiens from life-sustaining ecosystem services, and far too much of the biodiversity with which we find ourselves at crisis-level odds. It is a paradox dating back thousands of years, implicating millennia of human machinations that have been utterly ruinous to biological baselines. Those metrics are examined from numerous multidisciplinary approaches in this thoroughly original work, which aids readers, particularly natural history students, who aspire to grasp the far-reaching dimensions of the Anthropocene, as it affects every facet of human experience, past, present and future, and the rest of planetary sentience. With a Prologue by G. Wayne Clough, former Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and President Emeritus of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Foreword by Robert Gillespie, President of the non-profit, Population Communication.

AB  - Climate change is one of the major challenges of modern times. Its impacts are manifold and vary from sea level rise (especially relevant to those living in coastal areas), to the increased frequency of extreme events such as cyclones and storm surges, which not only poses problems to property and infrastructure, but also to human health. Climate change is also associated with damages to the physical and natural environment, as well as to biodiversity. According to the 5th Assessment Report produced by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), many geographical regions across the world are moderately or highly vulnerable to climate change, whose impacts may be further exacerbated by other human-induced pressures. The above state of affairs illustrates the need for a better and more holistic understanding of how climate change affects countries and regions on the one hand, but also on how the many problems it causes may be managed on the other, vis-a-vis a better ability to adapt. There is also a perceived need to showcase successful examples of how to duly address and manage the many social, economic and political problems posed by climate change around the world, in order to replicate and even upscale the successful ones. It is against this background that the Handbook of Climate Change Management has been produced. It contains papers prepared by scholars, social movements, practitioners and members of governmental agencies, undertaking research and/or executing climate change projects, and working with communities across all geographical regions. The Handbook focuses on "Research, Leadership, Transformation", meaning that it serves the purpose of showcasing the role these key areas play in respect of applied research, field projects and best practices to foster climate change adaptation worldwide.

AB  - This book includes recent research on disruptive technologies, tech ethics, and artificial intelligence. Due to the important advances in technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things or bioinformatics produced in recent years, it is necessary to conduct a thorough review of current ethical patterns. One of the research fields that is in full expansion and with a broad future is technology ethics or tech ethics. Just a few years ago, this type of research was a small part, and they did not have too many technology researchers involved. At present, due to the explosion of new applications of artificial intelligence, their problems and their legal barriers have flourished innumerable initiatives, declarations, principles, guides and analyses focused on measuring the social impact of these systems and on the development of a more ethical technology. It is, therefore, a problem that needs to be addressed from an academic and multidisciplinary point of view, where experts in ethics and behavior work together with experts in new and disruptive technologies. The international conference “Disruptive Technologies Tech Ethics and Artificial Intelligence” (DITTET 2021) provides a forum to present and discuss the latest scientific and technical advances and their implications in the field of ethics. It also provides a forum for experts to present their latest research in disruptive technologies, promoting knowledge transfer. It provides a unique opportunity to bring together experts in different fields, academics and professionals to exchange their experience in the development and deployment of disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence and their ethical problems. DiTTEt intends to bring together researchers and developers from industry, humanities and academia to report on the latest scientific advances and the application of artificial intelligence as well as its ethical implications in fields as diverse as climate change, politics, economy or security in today’s world. This book constitutes the refereed proceedings selected by an expert panel through a peer-review process. All these works will be presented by the experts in the different sessions organized at the DITTET congress to be held at the Pontifical University of Salamanca (Salamanca, Spain) on September 15, 26 and 17, 2021.

AB  - This book focuses on threats, especially contaminants, to drinking water and the supply system, especially in municipalities but also in industrial and even residential settings. The safety, security, and suitability landscape can be described as dynamic and complex stemming from necessity and hence culpability due to the emerging threats and risks, vis-a-vis globalization resulting in new forms of contaminants being used due to new technologies. The book provides knowledge and guidance for engineers, scientists, designers, researchers, and students who are involved in water, sustainability, and study of security issues. This book starts out with basics of water usage, current statistics, and an overview ofwater resources. The book then introduces different scenarios of safety and security and areas that researchers need to focus. Following that, the book presents different types of contaminants – inadvertent, intentional, or incidental. The next section presents different methodologies of contamination sensing/detection and remediation strategies as per guidance and standards set globally. The book then concludes with selected chapters on water management, including critical infrastructure that is critical to maintaining safe water supplies to cities and municipalities. Each chapter includes descriptive information for professionals in their respective fields. The breadth of chapters offers insights into how science (physical, natural, and social) and technology can support new developments to manage the complexity resident within the evolving threat and risk landscape.

AB  - The problems related to the process of industrialisation such as biodiversity depletion, climate change and a worsening of health and living conditions, especially but not only in developing countries, intensify. Therefore, there is an increasing need to search for integrated solutions to make development more sustainable. The United Nations has acknowledged the problem and approved the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. On 1st January 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda officially came into force. These goals cover the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. The Encyclopedia of the UN Sustainable Development Goals comprehensively addresses the SDGs in an integrated way. It encompasses 17 volumes, each one devoted to one of the 17 SDGs. This volume addresses SDG 9, namely “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation” and contains the description of a range of terms, to allow a better understanding and foster knowledge about it. This book presents a set of papers on the state of the art of knowledge and practices about three important aspects of sustainable development, infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. It focuses on the support of cleaner technologies, enhanced scientific research, domestic technology development and universal internet access. Concretely, the defined targets are: Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets Upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries Editorial Board Oluwabunmi Opeyemi Adejumo, Leah A Dundon, Lizhen Huang, Heather Jones, Haruna Musa Moda

AB  - Global climate change is bound to create a number of abiotic and biotic stresses in the environment, which would affect the overall growth and productivity of plants. Like other living beings, plants have the ability to protect themselves by evolving various mechanisms against stresses, despite being sessile in nature. They manage to withstand extremes of temperature, drought, flooding, salinity, heavy metals, atmospheric pollution, toxic chemicals and a variety of living organisms, especially viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, insects and arachnids and weeds. Incidence of abiotic stresses may alter the plant-pest interactions by enhancing susceptibility of plants to pathogenic organisms. These interactions often change plant response to abiotic stresses. Plant growth regulators modulate plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and regulate their growth and developmental cascades. A number of physiological and molecular processes that act together in a complex regulatory network, further manage these responses. Crosstalk between autophagy and hormones also occurs to develop tolerance in plants towards multiple abiotic stresses. Similarly, biostimulants, in combination with correct agronomic practices, have shown beneficial effects on plant metabolism due to the hormonal activity that stimulates different metabolic pathways. At the same time, they reduce the use of agrochemicals and impart tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. Further, the use of bio- and nano-fertilizers seem to hold promise to improve the nutrient use efficiency and hence the plant yield under stressful environments. It has also been shown that the seed priming agents impart stress tolerance. Additionally, tolerance or resistance to stress may also be induced by using specific chemical compounds such as polyamines, proline, glycine betaine, hydrogen sulfide, silicon, β-aminobutyric acid, γ-aminobutyric acid and so on. This book discusses the advances in plant performance under stressful conditions. It should be very useful to graduate students, researchers, and scientists in the fields of botanical science, crop science, agriculture, horticulture, ecological and environmental science.
